.,"There exist some interesting cases where the deformation structure becomes simple. One is the limit to the N=1/2 superspace [5], where the action should reduce to N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory with adjoint matter. Another interesting case is the singlet deformation [10,11], where the deformation parameters belongs to the singlet representation of the R-symmetry group SU(2)R. In this Letter, we will study N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in the harmonic superspace with singlet deformation. In this case, the gauge and supersymmetry transformations get correction linear in the deformation parameter. Therefore we can easily perform the field redefinition such that the component fields transform canonically under the gauge transformation. In the case of N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory, such field redefinition is also possible [5]. But in this case the component fields do not transform canonically under the deformed supersymmtery transformation. In the singlet case, we will show that there is a field redefinition such that the redefined fields also transform canonically under the deformed supersymmetry. We will construct a deformed Lagrangian which is invariant under both the gauge and supersymmetry transformations. We find that the deformed Lagrangian is characterized by a single function of an antiholomorphic scalar field.

.,"Improving as well as evaluating the performance of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications by migrating them to Cloud environments are widely considered as critical issues in the field of high performance and Cloud computing. However, poor network performance, heterogeneous and dynamic environments are some series of pitfalls for execution of HPC applications in Cloud. This paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance and scalability of HPC applications on Amazon's HPC Cloud. The evidence from our approach points a significant improvement in speed up and scale up with the response rate of more than 20 percent parallel efﬁciency on the Cloud in comparison to dedicated HPC cluster.

.,"Historically, the interest in accurate measurement of DNI started decades ago. Early studies (e.g., Linke, 1931; Linke and Ulmitz, 1940) identified the difficulty of separating the measurement of DNI from that of the diffuse irradiance in the immediate vicinity of the sun, hereafter referred to as circumsolar irradiance. Pastiels (1959) conducted a detailed study of the geometry of pyrheliometers, and how that geometry interacted with circumsolar radiance, using simplified representations of the latter. Various communications were then presented at a WMO Task Group meeting held in Belgium in 1966 (WMO, 1967) to improve the accuracy of pyrheliometric measurements, including estimates of the circumsolar enhancement. Ångström (1961) and Ångström and Rohde (1966) later contributed to the same topic, followed years later by Major (1973, 1980). The whole issue of instrument geometry vs. circumsolar irradiance was complex and confusing at the time because different makes and models of instruments had differing geometries. This was considerably simplified after WMO issued guidelines about the recommended geometry of pyrheliometers, which led to a relatively “standard” geometry used in all recent instruments. The experimental issues related to the measurement of DNI are discussed in Section 3.2.

.,"In the NJL model studied here, we find no stable stars with either CFL or normal quark matter cores. This is the opposite of the prediction of Ref. [15] where it was argued that there is no 2SC phase in compact stars. Let us be more precise: performing a Taylor expansion in the strange quark mass, the authors of Ref. [15] found that in beta-equilibrated electrically and color neutral quark matter the 2SC phase is always less favored than the CFL phase or normal quark matter. From this observation they concluded that the 2SC phase is absent in compact stars. In contrast to this result, it was shown in Ref. [16] in the framework of the NJL model that neutral 2SC matter could be the most favored quark phase in a certain regime. However, the authors argued that this interval might disappear if the hadronic phase is included more properly. This is indeed what we found for parameter set RKH, while for parameter set HK the 2SC phase survives only in a tiny window. Nevertheless, if Nature chooses to be similar to this equation of state, it will be this tiny window which gives rise to hybrid stars, whereas the CFL phase would be never present in compact stars.

.,"Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiographic (3D-DSA) images from diagnostic cerebral angiography were obtained at least one day prior to embolization in all patients. The raw data of 3D-DSA in a DICOM file were used for creating a 3D model of the target vessel segment. These data were converted to standard triangulation language (STL) surface data as an aggregation of fine triangular meshes using 3D visualization and measurement software (Amira version X, FEI, Burlington, MA, USA). An unstructured computational volumetric mesh was constructed from the triangulated surface. Smoothing and remeshing followed as next steps. The STL file was then transferred to a 3D printer (OBJET30 Pro; Stratasys Ltd., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). The resolution of the build layer was 0.028mm, and the 3D printed vessel model was produced using acrylic resin (Vero). Following immersion in water for a few hours, the surface of the 3D printed model was smoothed by manually removing spicule.

.,"In contrast with polymers, which are typically synthesized in the liquid phase, SWNTs are produced through a variety of synthesis techniques that typically involve the reaction of a gaseous carbon feedstock to form the nanotubes on catalyst particles. MWNTs were first observed in arc discharge fullerene reactors [1,26]; this technique was later adapted to produce SWNTs [3]. Similarly, the fullerene production method of laser ablation [27] was adapted to produce SWNTs (∼1.4nm diameter) in larger quantities on metal catalyst particles [28–30]. A number of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes have been developed to grow SWNTs and MWNTs, all involving the reaction of a gaseous carbon compound as feedstock. These processes include fluidized bed [31], “carpet” growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from catalyst particles embedded in a substrate [32–35] as shown in Fig. 3, and “catalytic gas flow CVD” [36,37]. One of the most effective, cheap, and scalable CVD techniques is the HiPco (high-pressure CO) process, which does not use pre-formed catalyst particles unlike most other CVD techniques [38].

.,"It is difficult in directly predicting permeability from porosity in tight sandstones due to the poor relationship between core derived porosity and permeability that caused by the extreme heterogeneity. The classical SDR (Schlumberger Doll Research) and Timur-Coates models are all unusable because not enough core samples were drilled for lab NMR experimental measurements to calibrate the involved model parameters. Based on the classification scale method (CSM), after the target tight sandstones are classified into two types, the relationship between core porosity and permeability is established for every type of formations, and the corresponding permeability estimation models are established.

.,"We shall establish the variational format in the space–time domain S=defΩ×I, for given spatial domain Ω and time domain I=(0,T), for a quite broad class of problems involving a first order time-derivative. In particular, the coupled problem of consolidation of geomaterials falls within this class. Another interesting application is the problem of dynamics, rewritten in first-order form, i.e. through a Hamiltonian description. It is of considerable interest to note from the outset that, due to the forward transport of information in time, it is always possible to consider a set of finite time intervals, whereby the solution at the end of any such interval will act as the initial data for the next one. To this end, we introduce a partition 0=t0<t1<⋯<tN=T of the considered time domain I=(0,T) into time-intervals In=(tn−1,tn) of length Δtn=tn−tn−1.11The abbreviated notation Δt=Δtn will be used henceforth for the current time step associated with In.

.,"At 200 – 300°C: nuclear densities are localised in the tetrahedral volume roughly covering the 8c and 32f positions with “bulges” of nuclear densities pointing toward the 48i position, while at 400 and 500°C continuous nuclear densities forming a straight line along the <100> direction are found, indicative of oxide-ion diffusion pathway along that direction. In the literature, curved pathways along the <100> direction passing through the 48i site are generally observed in fluorite materials [20], the prevalence of curve pathway as opposed from straight pathway is explained by the repulsion between cation and anions, the curved pathway allowing the cation–anion to maintain a reasonable distance. However, a straight pathway is observed for Y0.785Ta0.215O1.715 [23], as is the case for the present material. This suggests that Ta and Re cations might play a similar role in these systems.

.,"Observations show that in the same area with dimensions of a few tenths of a parsec could be many sources, some of which only emits OH lines, and some – only lines H2O. The only known in physics the emission mechanism that can give tremendous power within a narrow range of the spectrum, is coherent (i.e. the same phase and direction) light lasers, which are called optical lasers, and radio-masers. Cosmic maser radio sources emitting in the lines of the molecules have an extremely high brightness temperature radiation Tb. In the molecules of methanol masers (CH3OH) Tb value can reach 109 K, with masers hydroxyl molecules (OH) 6×1012 K. The typical size of the maser clusters is about 1014–1015 m and the neutron star radius is of the order of 10 km.

.,"Nuclear theory devoted major efforts since 4 decades to describe thermalization in nuclear reactions, predominantly using semi-classical methods  [13,14,10], in line with similar problems in quantum liquids  [15,16]. There were attempts to develop improved molecular dynamics methods combining quantum features with a semi classical treatment of dynamical correlations  [17,18]. Still, no clear-cut quantum approach is readily available yet, in spite of numerous formal attempts [19,20,10]. The field of clusters and nano structures is far younger but fast developing in relation to the ongoing developments of lasers and imaging techniques. Semiclassical approaches were also considered in the field to include some dynamical corrections  [21,22] and could qualitatively describe dynamical processes. But such approaches are bound to simple metals with sufficiently delocalized wave functions, and thus smooth potentials justifying semiclassical approximations. The case of organic systems, in particular the much celebrated C60   [4,23], cannot be treated this way. Semi classical, and even classical approaches, can be used at very high excitations such as delivered by very intense laser pulses  [2]. In such cases the system is blown up and details of its quantum mechanical features do not matter anymore. But for less violent scenarios, quantum shell effects cannot be ignored.

.,"An increase of neutron leakage from the core region can be achieved through modifications in the core geometry (usually by adopting a pan-cake geometry of the active core region at the expense of the general neutron economy). Extensive studies determined a set of core design modifications that optimised the total sodium void reactivity (becoming less positive). Among the most efficient design solutions identified is an enlarged sodium plenum above the active core region in combination with an absorber layer above the sodium plenum (to reduce neutron backscattering from the reflector region above the plenum). Fig. 19 shows the combined effect of different upper plenum thicknesses of the absorber and boron layers. It can be observed that the sequential increase of the layer's thickness converge to an asymptotic value of reactivity reduction slightly over 800pcm. The pair of values selected was 60cm for the sodium plenum and 30cm for the boron layer. These modifications implied a considerable increase in the sub-assembly length that was compensated by reducing the upper axial reflector width (Sun et al., 2013).

.,"Although the basic mechanisms of the AD process are reasonably well understood, it has not proved simple to apply existing theories to the interpretation of experimental data. What is needed is a combination of the AD theory and the electronic structure of realistic systems, including surface defects and adsorbed species. Such electronic structure calculations are still complex and time-consuming. In many cases, especially for insulating surfaces, attempts to model MIES spectra use simple or intuitive models. In Refs. [4,6,23] it is assumed that the main transition mechanism is Auger de-excitation, and the MIES spectra have been simulated by the surface density of states (DOS) projected on the surface oxygen ions of the uppermost surface layer using a Hartree–Fock method (the crystal code [24,25]) and a density functional theory (DFT) method (the cetep code [26]). The effect of the overlap between the surface and He(1s) wavefunctions was taken into account only approximately by applying an additional z-dependent exponential factor to the surface DOS. Other workers [5,6] estimated the AD transition probability using a DOS projected on to the projectile 1s atomic orbital. However, they were not able to use state-of-the-art methods for the surface electronic structure. Yet the success of the simplified treatments [4–6], especially for MIES features such as relative energies of the different peaks, suggests that real spectra are indeed related to the projection of the surface DOS on to the projectile orbital.

.,"Volume EM can be performed using transmission or scanning electron microscopes. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice is dependant on the required lateral (x, y) and axial (z) resolution, and the size of the structure of interest. Historically, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was the tool of choice for ultrastructural examination of biomedical specimens at sub-nanometer resolution. However, for many cell biology studies structural resolution is actually limited by the deposition of heavy metals onto membranes during sample preparation. In addition, voxel dimensions may only need to be half that of the smallest expected feature of interest (Briggman and Bock, 2012). Advances in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technology are now driving a paradigm shift in electron imaging. SEMs with field emission electron sources and high efficiency electron detectors can achieve lateral resolutions in the order of 3nm, allowing visualisation of structures such as synaptic vesicles and membranes (De Winter et al., 2009; Knott et al., 2008; Vihinen et al., 2013; Villinger et al., 2012), though resolving individual leaflets of membrane bilayers remains a challenge (Vihinen et al., 2013).

.,"The propagation of unsteady disturbances in ducts of slowly-varying geometry, such as those typical of an aeroengine, can be successfully modelled using a multiple scales approach. From the first application [1] of multiple-scales analysis to sound propagation in ducts of rectangular and circular cross section without mean flow, more recent developments have extended the method to cases with uniform mean flow [2], mean swirling flow [3], ducts of arbitrary cross section [4] (with uniform mean flow) and strongly curved ducts [5]. The multiple-scales approach has a number of distinct advantages over full numerical methods as it is ideally suited to handle higher frequencies and the computational complexity is only marginally more than calculating the eigenmodes inside a straight parallel duct. The accuracy and usefulness of the multiple scales approach has been validated against finite-element methods [6] for realistic aeroengine configurations and acoustic frequencies [7,8].

.,"AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy is widely used for aerospace applications due to its high strength to weight ratio and high damage tolerance that result from copper and magnesium as the principal alloying elements and appropriate thermomechanical processing. The microstructure of the alloy is relatively complex and a number of compositionally-distinct phases have been identified [1]. Although possessing favourable mechanical properties, the alloy is relatively susceptible to corrosion and generally requires surface treatment in practical applications. The corrosion behaviour of the alloy is particularly affected by the presence of the intermetallic particles due to their differing potentials with respect to the alloy matrix [2–9]. Copper-containing second phase particles at the alloy surface are particularly detrimental to the corrosion resistance as they provide preferential cathodic sites [2,10]. One of the principle types of second phase particle that is important to the corrosion behaviour of the alloy is the S phase (Al2CuMg) particle [1,11]. Dealloying of S phase particles, which may account for ∼60% of the constituent particles in AA2024 alloys [11], is commonly observed when the alloy is exposed to an aggressive environment. The particles are considered as important initiation sites for severe localized corrosion in the alloy [11–22]. The dealloying of the S phase particles and the resulting enrichment of copper result in a decrease of the Volta potential with respect to the matrix and hence the dealloyed particles become active cathodic sites [23–25].

.,"In contrast to the H particle, the situation for the Θ+ baryon is very promising. Thus, in this Letter we explore the formation of the Θ+-baryon within a new approach called parton-based Gribov–Regge theory. It is realized in the Monte Carlo program NEXUS 3.97 [22,23]. In this model high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions are treated within a self-consistent quantum mechanical multiple scattering formalism. Elementary interactions, happening in parallel, correspond to underlying microscopic (predominantly soft) parton cascades and are described effectively as phenomenological soft pomeron exchanges. A pomeron can be seen as layers of a (soft) parton ladder, which is attached to projectile and target nucleons via leg partons. At high energies one accounts also for the contribution of perturbative (high pt) partons described by a so-called “semihard pomeron”—a piece of the QCD parton ladder sandwiched between two soft pomerons which are connected to the projectile and to the target in the usual way. The spectator partons of both projectile and target nucleons, left after pomeron emissions, form nucleon remnants. The legs of the pomerons form color singlets, such as q–q̄, q–qq or q̄–q̄q̄. The probability of q–qq and q̄–q̄q̄ is controlled by the parameter Pqq and is fixed by the experimental yields on (multi-)strange baryons [23].

.,"Several methods based on dynamical assumptions were suggested for determination of the P-parity of the Θ+ [13]. According to a general theorem [14], in order to determine the parity of one particle in a binary reaction one has to know polarizations at least of two fermions participating in this reaction. Model independent methods for determination of the P-parity of the Θ+ were suggested recently in Refs. [15,16] for pp-collision, and in Ref. [17] for photoproduction of the Θ+. The method of Refs. [15,16], based on the assumption that the spin of the Θ+ equals 12, suggests to measure the spin–spin correlation parameter in the reaction p→p→→Σ+Θ+ near the threshold. We generalize here this method for an arbitrary spin of the Θ+ and both isospins T=0 and T=1 of the NN channel of the NN→YΘ+ reaction. Furthermore, we consider a polarization transfer from a nucleon to the hyperon Y in this reaction. Our consideration is model independent, since it is based only on conservation of the P-parity, total angular momentum and isospin in the reaction and the generalized Pauli principle for nucleons.

Frankel presented a method to directly measure the average anodic current density from the growing pit boundary velocity in Al [33], an Al alloy [34] and Ni–Fe [35] thin films. Subsequently, Ryan et al. [27,36] determined the anodic current density in pits propagating as 2D disks in stainless steel thin films by measuring the pit edge movement velocity. Ernst and Newman [11,12,37] studied stability of pit growth in detail and measured the kinetics of 2D pit propagation in depth and width and compared the results with kinetics in 1D pencil electrodes. They developed a semi-quantitative model for pit propagation which explained the lacy pit cover formation during the pit growth, although they did not measure current density within the pit. More recently, Tang and Davenport [38] tracked the pit boundary movement and computed the instantaneous but average current density in Fe-Co thin films. However, there have been no previous attempts to quantify the local current density during inhomogeneous growth of pits, although such local variation in current density has long been recognised [7].

.,"Absorption events through the charged current reactions (2)νe+40Ar→e−+40K∗andν̄e+40Ar→e++40Cl∗. There is some uncertainty in predicting e−(e+) event rates for these processes which arise due to the nuclear model dependencies of the absorption cross section and the treatment of the Coulomb distortion of electron (positron) in the field of the residual nucleus. The nuclear absorption cross section for the charged current neutrino reactions in 40Ar relevant to supernova neutrino energies was first calculated by Raghavan [10] and Bahcall et al. [11] for Fermi transitions leading to isobaric analogue state (IAS) at 4.38 MeV in 40K∗. Later Ormand et al. [12] used a shell model to calculate the Fermi and Gamow–Teller transitions. In these calculations Fermi function F(Z,Ee) was used to take into account the Coulomb effects. In a recent paper Bueno et al. [13] make use of a calculation by Martinez-Pinedo et al. [14] who use a shell model for Fermi and Gamow–Teller transitions and a continuum random phase approximation (CRPA) for forbidden transitions to calculate the absorption cross sections. In this calculation the Coulomb distortion of the produced electron is treated with a hybrid model where a Fermi function is used for lower electron energies and modified effective momentum approximation (MEMA) for higher electron energies [14–17].

In Section 2 we briefly describe the problem of cell tracking and introduce our approach to cell tracking, which may be regarded as fitting a mathematical model to experimental image data sets. We present the geometric evolution law model we seek to fit, which is a simplification of recently developed models in the literature that show good agreement with experiments [8,10–12,4,13,9]. We finish Section 2 by reformulating our model into the phase field framework, which appears more suitable for the problem in hand, and we formulate the cell tracking problem as a PDE constrained optimisation problem. In Section 3 we propose an algorithm for the resolution of the PDE constrained optimisation problem and we discuss some practical aspects related to the implementation. In particular we note that the theoretical and computational framework may be applied directly to multi-cell image data sets and raw image data sets (of sufficient quality) without segmentation. In Section 4 we present some numerical examples for the case of 2d single and multi-cell image data sets. Finally in Section 5 we present some conclusions of our study and discuss future extensions and applications of the work.

.,"The product change between batches #1/#2 and the others is the most influential on the test results. The redesign and upgrade to 110-nm process technology reduces the pass rate at LNT by approximately half. This is mainly caused by the increased incidence of erase and program timeouts with some contribution from long erase and program times and bit errors. The difference in pass rates at 88K between batches #3/#4 and #5/#6, which use the same process technology with the same dimensions, can be explained by the fabrication in different assembly lines, where other processes or base materials may have been changed. This means different tolerances in base materials and production process, which are more pronounced the lower the temperature.

.,"When dominated by surface shadowing mechanisms, the aggregation of vapor particles onto a surface is a complex, non-local phenomenon. In the literature, there have been many attempts to analyze the growth mechanism by means of pure geometrical considerations; i.e., by assuming that vapor particles arrive at the film surface along a single angular direction [38,41]. Continuum approaches, which are based on the fact that the geometrical features of the film (i.e., the nanocolumns) are much larger than the typical size of an atom [42,266,267], have been also explored. For instance, Poxson et al. [228] developed an analytic model that takes into account geometrical factors as well as surface diffusion. This model accurately predicted the porosity and deposition rate of thin films using a single input parameter related to the cross-sectional area of the nanocolumns, the volume of material and the thickness of the film. Moreover, in Ref. [39], an analytical semi-empirical model was presented to quantitatively describe the aggregation of columnar structures by means of a single parameter dubbed the fan angle. This material-dependent quantity can be experimentally obtained by performing deposition at normal incidence on an imprinted groove seeded substrate, and then measuring the increase in column diameter with film thickness. This model was tested under various conditions [40], which returned good results and an accurate prediction of the relation between the incident angle of the deposition flux and the tilt angle of the columns for several materials.

.,"As mentioned previously, the weakly penalized system can be thought of as a generalized formulation which can result in the PL, penalty or statically condensed PL formulations depending on the choice of the projection operator. The equivalence of these methods under the weakly penalized regime, allows us to combine and take advantage of the good characteristics of each method. For instance, the weakly penalized formulation combines the simplified structure of the penalty method with the convergence characteristics of the PL formulation. However, due to the stiffness of the linear system at high values of the bulk modulus, the penalized formulations (classic penalty/weakly penalized) exhibit deteriorated nonlinear convergence. This stands in stark contrast to the PL method which (for inf–sup stable schemes) exhibits fast convergence even for high bulk modulus. However, we observe that, when the choice of πh provides equivalence with the discrete PL method, poor nonlinear convergence is observed though, in principle, the convergence should be similar. Examining the update formulae for both weakly penalized and PL approaches (see Appendix C), we observe that deteriorated convergence stems from: (1) initial residual amplification, and (2) the amplification of the residual.

.,"The need to represent scale interactions in weather and climate prediction models has, for many decades, motivated research into the use of adaptive meshes [3,34,38]. R-adaptivity – mesh redistribution – involves deforming a mesh in order to vary local resolution and was first considered for atmospheric modelling more than twenty years ago by Dietachmayer and Droegemeier [14]. It is an attractive form of adaptivity since it does not involve altering the mesh connectivity, does not create load balancing problems because points are never created or destroyed, does not require mapping of solutions between meshes [26], does not lead to sudden changes in resolution and can be retro-fitted into existing models. Variational methods exist which attempt to control resolution in different directions for r-adaptive meshes (e.g. [23,25]). Alternatively, the solution of the Monge–Ampère equation to generate an optimally transported (OT) mesh based on a scalar valued monitor function is a useful form of r-adaptive mesh generation because it generates a mesh equidistributed with respect to a monitor function and does not lead to mesh tangling [7]. We will see that the optimal transport problem on the sphere leads to a slightly different equation of Monge–Ampère type, which has not before been solved numerically on the surface of a sphere, which would be necessary for weather and climate prediction using r-adaptivity.

.,"With ever increasing computer performance, simulations in much larger systems have become feasible. However, full-atomistic approaches to polymer crystallization need extremely large computer power even in the case of simple polymers, and appropriate modeling or coarse-graining of the system is imperative. From a series of work on the development of coarse-grained models for polymers, Mayer and Muller-Plathe have build up a model of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for studying early stage of crystallization. They investigated the emergence of crystalline order from the isotropic melt by rapid quenching [51,52]. They could reproduce many elementary processes of homogenous nucleation that showed good correspondence with experiments and other simulations, in temperature dependence of lamella thickness, structure of fold surface, etc. In their work, they neglected long-range force (van der Waals attraction) to accelerate computation. Their model has the energy contribution due to intrachain interactions only and the dominant driving force for crystallization is entropic, which seems to ignore dominant driving force for polymer crystallization in conventional sense. However, their work is reminiscent of the classical solid–liquid transition in systems of repulsive spherical atoms [53] and poses an intriguing problem as to the intrinsic driving force for polymer crystallization.

.,"There are some relevant studies on information dissemination in transportation systems using simulations. One category of studies look at how either local information (only about the neighbours) or global information (about the entire network) affects the global network performance. Our approach is different in the sense that we investigate the impact of information on the global network performance depending on the fraction of people that receive information. We analyse what is the effect of real time information dissemination and explain why this effect appears. Information is disseminated in real time and contains global details about how congested the roads are. This approach is important as it gives insights on the impact that massive use of real-time information can have on traffic. This can be useful for building more intelligent traffic control mechanisms where information is a steering tool.

.,"One way to enforce this ratio is to use a probabilistic, ‘roulette wheel’ style lane selection policy. VISSIM, along with most simulation toolkits, offers methods to specify probabilistic routing whereby a defined percentage of vehicles are sent down unique routes. This is a piecewise technique that can be reapplied at various locations around a simulation. While these methods are attractive from a calibration perspective as exact representations of existing statistics can be ensured, the process is an unrealistic one as it assumes that drivers make probabilistic decisions at precise locations. So in this case when a vehicle arrives at a point prior to the weighbridges it is allocated one of the lanes based on the respective probabilities. It turns out that this method leads to significant variations in trip times depending on the initial random number seed, this can be seen in a graphic of the key areas of the simulation for the 2 different runs (Fig. 7). One of the benefits of graphical microsimulation is that the 2D and 3D simulations help the researcher to visualise a new scheme and its potential benefits but also to highlight unrealistic behaviour. Fig. 7 shows the congestion at the decision point for 2 different runs. Using probabilistic routing to enforce correct routing percentages is a clear case of overcalibration affecting simulation brittleness.

.,"The Discrete Element Method applied to spheres is well established as a reasonably realistic tool, in a wide range of engineering disciplines, for modelling packing and flow of granular materials; Asmar et al. [8] describes the fundamentals of this method as applied by code developed in-house at Nottingham; since these are widely documented the details are not reproduced here, simply a summary. It applies an explicit time stepping approach to numerically integrate the translational and rotational motion of each particle from the resulting forces and moments acting on them at each timestep. The inter-particle and particle wall contacts are modelled using the linear spring–dashpot–slider analogy. Contact forces are modelled in the normal and tangential directions with respect to the line connecting the particles centres. Particle elastic stiffness is set so sphere “overlap” is not significant and moderate contact damping is applied. Particle cohesion can also be modelled but is assumed to be negligible in the current study. The translational and rotational motion of each particle is modelled using a half step leap-frog Verlet numerical integration scheme to update particle positions and velocities. Near-neighbour lists are used to increase the computational efficiency of determining particle contacts and a zoning method is used each time the list is composed; that is the system is divided into cubic regions, each particle centre is within one zone, and potential contacting particles are within the same or next-door neighbour zones. Full details are given in Asmar et al. [8].

In both, nanocomplexes were prepared in water at a range of molar charge ratios of L to D while the peptide P to D molar charge ratio was maintained constant at 3:1.

Irrespective of the method of order of mixing, all molar charge ratios in this study refer to L:P:D.

.,"One of the most important outcomes of the comparative analysis is the fact that in all tested cases the use of FM is associated with a dramatic reduction in computational time when compared with FE, generally being in the order of seconds for FM and in the order of hours for FE. Table 1 reports the timings of the simulations for both methods. Free expansion is the fastest case, where FM reaches the load-free configuration in just 2 s, while simulations inside the vessels with the diameter of around 30 mm take approximately 30 s. Most of the execution time of the FM deployment algorithm is dedicated to the contact check and calculations of the implications the vessel wall has on the stent structure. Interestingly, in both methods, the highest computational time (i.e., curved vessels) is not associated with the most complex geometry (i.e., patient-specific case of aortic dissection). Another fact worth mentioning is the relation of the computational time to the diameter of the vessel in both methods. While the computational time of FM appeared to be directly related to the diameter of the vessel, no immediate relation was found for the FE simulations. Such outcome is probably related to the simplified contact model used by FM, which makes the stent-graft expansion terminate once the nodes come in contact with the vessel wall. On the contrary, it is well known that the contact algorithm used in the FE analyses increases the computational cost of the simulations.

.,"The final contribution to the force is the van der Waals interaction. It includes the following contributions: (i) between the macroscopic Si tip of conical shape with the sphere of radius R at the end [27] and semi-infinite substrate; (ii) the dispersion forces between the atoms in the sample treated atomistically; and (iii) the interaction between the macroscopic part of the tip and the sample atoms. The first contribution is calculated analytically [27]. In fact, the macroscopic contribution to the van der Waals force is the same in each of the three systems described below, as it depends only on the tip–surface separation, macroscopic sphere radius, cone-angle and Hamaker constant of the system [27]. All these quantities are identical in each system we look at, so that the van der Waals force acts as a background attractive force independent of the microscopic properties of the system [8]. The Hamaker constant needed for the calculation of the macroscopic van der Waals force is estimated to be 0.5eV [32].

.,"When incompatible three component polymer chains are tethered at a junction point, the resultant star molecules of the ABC type are in a very frustrated field in bulk. That is, their junction points cannot be aligned on two-dimensional planes but on one-dimensional lines, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, when the chain length difference is not so large, the array of junction points tends to be straight and long one. Consequently each domain with mesoscopic sizes becomes cylinders, and their cross sections could be conformed by polygons [28,29]. This is because three interfaces, A/B, B/C and C/A are likely to be flat since there exist no junction points at interfaces and therefore chain entropy contribution to the free energy of structure formation is considerably small comparing with regular block and graft copolymer systems. As a matter of fact, Dotera predicted several tiling patterns by the diagonal bond method, a new Monte Carlo Simulation [30], while Gemma and Dotera pointed out that only three regular tilings, i.e., (6.6.6), (4.8.8) and (4.6.12) are permitted for three-branched molecules proposed as the “even polygon theorem” [31].

.,"Let us now consider the case of a beta-beam source. Similarly to the case of a static tritium source, an advantage of the beta-beams is that the neutrino fluxes can be very accurately calculated. Fig. 3 shows the electron–neutrino scattering events in the range of 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV and 1 keV to 10 keV, respectively. (In Fig. 3(b) we have rounded to the nearest integer number of counts.) The shape of the flux-averaged cross sections is very similar to the reactor case as reflected in the event rates shown in the figures. As can be seen, by measuring electron recoils in the keV range with a beta-beam source one could, with a sufficiently strong source, have a very clear signature for a neutrino magnetic moment of 5×10−11μB. These figures are for Helium-6 ions, however, similar results can be obtained using neutrinos from 18Ne. The results shown are obtained for an intensity of 1015 ν/s (i.e., 1015  ions/s). If there is no magnetic moment, this intensity will produce about 170 events in the 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV range per year and 3 events in the 1 keV to 10 keV range per year. These numbers increase to 210 and 55, respectively, in the case of a magnetic moment of 5×10−11μB.

.,"This phase was completed in 2005. Previous contracts had been procured with the contractor providing the detailed design. For this system the design was undertaken by Mott MacDonald. It was developed by looking at the systems installed previously and calculating what was actually required to achieve cathodic protection of the piers. This resulted in a significant reduction in the number of zones and monitoring probes. The varying amounts of steelwork in the beams had previously lead to up to 5 zones per beam, with multiple layers of mesh to achieve the design current density. On review of the data the operating current density was similar in all zones and so this was reduced to a single zone per beam. The encapsulation was susceptible to ASR and contained post tensioning and so it was decided to use a galvanic system based on Galvashield CC anodes from Fosroc. Our design did not include an option to allow depolarization of the galvanic system, but the contractor supplied one, such that the anodes could be remotely disconnected. The control unit was from Electrotech CP and operated via a broadband connection provided by the contractor.

The analysis relies essentially on some new regularity results of the multi-term time fractional diffusion equation. Further, we have developed a fully discrete scheme based on a finite difference discretization of the Caputo fractional derivatives.

The measurements were carried out under an argon atmosphere (with an oxygen content of 7 ppm), using pure platinum ingots (64–144 mg) of 99.95 at % purity as a reference material. The temperature range of the experiment was from 430.3 K to 1088.8 K using steps of 50 K. Each isothermal run consisted of 2–4 drops of Bi2UO6 samples, each surrounded by two drops of platinum from which the sensitivity of the device was determined. The drops were separated by time intervals of 20 min, long enough to re-stabilize the monitored heat flow signal. Background subtraction and peak integration were performed using commercially available software for data processing. The reported temperatures were corrected in accordance with the calibration curve obtained prior to measurement using several high purity standard metals (Sn, Pb, Zn, Al, Ag, Ni) with various melting temperatures in order to cover the whole temperature range of the measurement. After drop calorimetric measurements at the maximum considered temperature, the material was subjected to a new XRD measurement, confirming the stability of the compound under the experimental conditions.

There exist running in and steady wear period in the wear process of uncoated AZ31 and anodizing coating without Al2O3 nanoparticles while there has a steady wear period only in the wear process of composite anodizing coating with Al2O3 nanoparticles. At the same time, the addition of nano-particles to electrolyte led to reduction of friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of composite coating is relatively lower and more stable than what has been reported in literature [24,25] for anodizing coatings. This may be caused by “rolling effect” made by Al2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of oxide coating. Spherical nanoparticles change sliding into rolling, which reduce friction, making the friction coefficient becomes more stable. The friction coefficient of anodizing coating without Al2O3 nanoparticles has large fluctuation maybe for the damage of coating. In contrast to the uncoated AZ31 magnesium alloy, the anodizing coatings show slightly lower friction coefficient. This can be attributed to their higher load-bearing capacity for high hardness.

This is still short compared to operating times, so is important to consider the equilibrium result of such processes: If the vacancies and SIAs were likely to find their Frenkel partner, recombine, and annihilate, then the metal should essentially return to its original structure; however, if defects instead formed large clusters of a single type this could result in formation of voids, dislocation loops or swelling, possibly weakening the material in the process.

We aim at clarifying, via specific examples, the relation between a functional which is local in a particular gauge (but not necessarily gauge invariant), and its gauge invariant extension (which is not necessarily local). We show that the non-localities found are not perturbatively local because they cannot be expressed in terms of an infinite derivative expansion. We believe that the implications of this observation have not been clearly emphasised in the literature, as attested by the absence of any debate about it in recent works. It is precisely these dangerous infrared modes that make it hard to define a gauge independent renormalisation for the gauge invariant extensions of local functionals. This observation supports the remark in [2] that the expectation value receives important contributions from both large and small distances. Our arguments on renormalisability are based on the notion of renormalisation in the modern sense [8] which relies on BRST cohomology theorems.

.,"Certainly therefore the see-saw mechanism is an attractive explanation of why the light neutrino masses are so small. However, it is not without its faults. In particular, there is a tension between the strongly hierarchical nature of the observed Yukawa couplings in the quark and charged lepton sectors, and the essentially hierarchy-free masses implied by the Δm2's. Moreover, both the θ12 and θ23 mixing angles are large while the angle θ13 is small which is in sharp contrast with the corresponding mixings in the quark sector which are all small. These problems can be solved in specific models, for example, the Δm2 values can be fitted by taking the spectrum of rhd neutrino masses to be hierarchical in such a way as to almost compensate for the hierarchical neutrino Yukawa couplings. But this has the price of introducing a wide range of rhd neutrino masses MR∼1010–1015 which then require explanation.

.,"This research traces the implementation of an information system in the form of ERP modules covering tenant and contract management in a Chinese service company. Misalignments between the ERP system specification and user needs led to the adoption of informal processes within the organisation. These processes are facilitated within an informal organisational structure and are based on human interactions undertaken within the formal organisation. Rather than to attempt to suppress the emergence of the informal organisation the company decided to channel the energies of staff involved in informal processes towards organisational goals. The company achieved this by harnessing the capabilities of what we term a hybrid ERP system, combining the functionality of a traditional (formal) ERP installation with the capabilities of Enterprise Social Software (ESS). However the company recognised that the successful operation of the hybrid ERP system would require a number of changes in organisational design in areas such as reporting structures and communication channels. A narrative provided by interviews with company personnel is thematised around the formal and informal characteristics of the organisation as defined in the literature. This leads to a definition of the characteristics of the hybrid organisation and strategies for enabling a hybrid organisation, facilitated by a hybrid ERP system, which directs formal and informal behaviour towards organisational goals and provides a template for future hybrid implementations.

Furthermore, PAs can function as biomimetic materials exemplified by collagen-mimetic PAs [92]. Conventional materials often rely on electrospinning as a manufacturing method to achieve fiber-like structures suitable for use in nerve regeneration. The self-assembly nature of PAs allows them to circumvent costly manufacturing methods. However, in contrast to conventional manufacturing methods like electrospinning where quality and batch-to-batch variability can be tightly controlled, merely relying on self-assembly as a method of large-scale commercial production is still an experimental concept. Perhaps the next step would be to carefully compare and contrast the robustness of self-assemled PAs to electrospun nanofibers. Given that the constituent elements in PAs and external factors like pH can affect its structural assembly, parameters must be finely tuned and optimized in order for PA nanofibers to be used as a full-fledged commercialized medical product [93].

The degree to which the rates are effected depends on the distribution of residual defects post a cascade event, in addition to the concentration and ordering of the Ga atoms. If vacancies and interstitials become greatly separated after the collision cascade, then pathways to recombination are likely to become restricted and recovery times will be extended. This is viable for cascades that created a vacancy rich core surrounded by dispersed interstitials, as found for the low energy cascades in Pu and PuGa [11,12]. This may also be the case for channelling events, where energetic atoms travel deep into the lattice through channels of low atomic density.

.,"Xylanases have potential applications in various fields. Some of the important applications are as fallows. Xylanases are used as bleaching agent in the pulp and paper industry. Mostly they are used to hydrolyzed the xylan component from wood which facilitate in removal of lignin (Viikari, Kantelinen, Buchert, & Puls, 1994). It also helps in brightening of the pulp to avoid the chlorine free bleaching operations (Paice, Jurasek, Ho, Bourbonnais, & Archibald, 1989). In bakeries the xylanase act on the gluten fraction of the dough and help in the even redistribution of the water content of the bread (Wong & Saddler, 1992). Xylanases also have potential application in animal feed industry. They are used for the hydrolysis of non-starchy polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan in monogastric diets (Walsh, Power, & Headon, 1993). Xylanases also play a key role in the maceration of vegetable matter (Beck & Scoot, 1974), protoplastation of plant cells, clarification of juices and wine (Biely, 1985) liquefaction of coffee mucilage for making liquid coffee, recovery of oil from subterranian mines, extraction of flavors and pigments, plant oils and starch (McCleary, 1986) and to improve the efficiency of agricultural silage production (Wong & Saddler, 1992).

.,"From this study where a commercial Al–12Si alloy was inoculated with different level of Nb+B addition to assess the grain refining potency of Nb+B inoculation it can be concluded that in-situ formed Nb-based intermetallics compounds are potent heterogeneous nucleation substrates with high potency for the refinement of Al–Si cast alloys. The primary α-Al dendritic grain size varies with the addition level of Nb and B. Moreover, significant grain refinement over a wide range of cooling rates is obtained via enhanced heterogeneous nucleation making the grain size of the material less sensitive to the cooling rate. Nb+B inoculants are characterised by some fading which is still acceptable after 4 h of contact time. Moreover, alloys refined by means of Nb+B inoculants can be recycled obtaining a fine grain structure with small addition or no further addition of inoculants after the first initial addition. Concluding, Nb+B inoculation is a promising candidate for the refinement of cast Al alloy which could lead to their wider employment in the automotive industry with the resultant intrinsic advantages of lighter structural component from an environmental point of view.

.,"In this paper, however, we prefer the simpler ‘framed’ cell employed by Hadjiconstantinou and Patera [16], where the shear stress is generated by constraining the velocity in a ‘frame’ rather than by modifying the shape of the box. The framed cell is periodic, but we cannot simply calculate the average stress in the whole box because the presence of an external buffer would produce spurious results. We need the local stress in the core region, but this complicates the Oij term in Eq. (3). There are other methods to calculate the stress tensor such as the method of planes [32], the volume-average approach [26,14], or the method derived from the Schweitz virial relation [25], but, in general, we must choose between a complicated computational cell (i.e. Lees–Edwards cell) and simplifying the calculation of the momentum flux, or a simple cell (i.e. framed cell) and complicating the calculation of the momentum flux. The new method we propose here does not need the direct calculation of the flux, so it avoids this issue altogether: we can use the framed cell and, at the same time, avoid the calculation of the IK equation.

Section 2 considers the implications of the coupling between the spin of a classical electron and the rapidly varying electromagnetic field produced by a laser-driven plasma wave. Sufficiently short, high-intensity laser pulses can form longitudinal waves within the electron density of a plasma. These density waves propagate with speed comparable to the group speed of the laser pulse. Not all plasma electrons form this wave, however; some of the electrons are caught up in the wave and accelerated by its high fields. The wave eventually collapses as these electrons damp the wave (the wave ‘breaks’). The extremely high electric field gradient of a plasma wave near wavebreaking provides an excellent theoretical testing ground for the effects of Stern–Gerlach-type contributions to the trajectory of a test electron.

The SNR of scans of three slots of varying depth were enhanced by a factor of up to 3.7, from the SNR measured at 1MHz. This is a result of a defect-decoupling resonance-shift effect and is referred to as the near electrical resonance signal enhancement (NERSE) phenomenon. NERSE frequency operation has significant potential for ECT inspection, and opens up a range of investigative possibilities.

Indeed, in the Randall–Sundrum model in five dimensions [2], the following facts are well known: spin 0 field is localized on a brane with positive tension which also localizes the graviton while the spin 1/2 and 3/2 fields are localized not on a brane with positive tension but on a brane with negative tension [6]. Spin 1 field is not localized neither on a brane with positive tension nor on a brane with negative tension [7]. In six space–time dimensions, the spin 1 gauge field is also localized on the brane [8]. Thus, in order to fulfill the localization of Standard Model particles on a brane with positive tension, it seems that some additional interactions except the gravitational interaction must be also introduced in the bulk.

Full details of our vacuum-fabrication procedures have been given in previous publications [17–19,23]. Briefly, aluminium gate electrodes and associated tracks were vacuum evaporated onto the substrates through shadow masks. Subsequently, the substrates were attached to a cooled web-coater drum (Aerre Machines). With the drum rotating at a linear speed of 25m/min under vacuum, flash-evaporated TPGDA monomer vapour which condensed onto the substrates was cross-linked by exposure, in situ, to a plasma. The resulting smooth, pinhole-free films were typically 500nm to 1μm thick with a measured dielectric constant varying in the range 4–5. For circuit fabrication, the insulator was patterned using shadow masks to define rectangular areas separated by 1mm gaps to act as vias for inter-layer metallic connections. The substrates were then transferred into an evaporator (Minispectros, Kurt Lesker) integrated into a nitrogen glovebox for the vacuum-deposition (2.4nm/min) of DNTT onto the insulator. Without exposing the substrates to ambient air, the gold source/drain metallisation layer was deposited through a shadow mask in the same evaporator.

Indeed, cross-overs in the approximate global free energy minimum for this system (where the free energy of the second-lowest potential energy minimum becomes lower than that of the global potential energy minimum) in the harmonic approximation would occur at 1170K. In general, the harmonic prediction for the crossover temperature between two minima is(4)kBTxo=V1−V2ln((o2ν¯2κ)/(o1ν¯1κ)),from Eq.

The vibrational combination states of the alcohols are coupled by the femtosecond laser pulses at 1560nm. These couplings result in the absorption of 1560nm and the excited molecules undergo relaxation through non-radiative processes, which gives rise to transient thermal effects. These transient thermal effects are related to the pure optical nonlinearity of the samples and can be measured as a change in their n2 values [14].

.,"Inspired by energy-fueled phenomena such as cortical cytoskeleton flows [46,45,32] during biological morphogenesis, the theory of active polar viscous gels has been developed [37,33]. The theory models the continuum, macroscopic mechanics of a collection of uniaxial active agents, embedded in a viscous bulk medium, in which internal stresses are induced due to dissipation of energy [41,58]. The energy-consuming uniaxial polar agents constituting the gel are modeled as unit vectors. The average of unit vectors in a small local volume at each point defines the macroscopic directionality of the agents and is described by a polarization field. The polarization field is governed by an equation of motion accounting for energy consumption and for the strain rate in the fluid. The relationship between the strain rate and the stress in the fluid is provided by a constitutive equation that accounts for anisotropic, polar agents and consumption of energy. These equations, along with conservation of momentum, provide a continuum hydrodynamic description modeling active polar viscous gels as an energy consuming, anisotropic, non-Newtonian fluid [37,33,32,41]. The resulting partial differential equations governing the hydrodynamics of active polar viscous gels are, however, in general analytically intractable.

The previous SRC-HE module is then replaced by the generalised cross correlation phase transform (GCC-PHAT) introduced in Section 2.1, as this does not involve cumbersome point function estimations. The drawback is that the basic GCC algorithm can only detect one source at a time and it is known to be sensitive to room reverberations [5], however it is still effective under moderate reverberant environments (T60≈0.3s) [40]. For these reasons, at first experiments where only a speaker is active at any given time are carried out, as it often happens in a polite conversation between two or more people. Speech segments using a voice activity detector (VAD) [41] are further extracted and processed using a GCC-PHAT step, for the signal to be more robust to reverberations. Thus, the measure vector obtained za (see Section 2.1) can now be rewritten as za={τm(t)}, where each component τm is the TDOA collected at the m-th microphone pair at each time step t.

The total conductivity of the samples was measured using a conventional four-terminal method. Bar samples were prepared by calcination at 1300°C for 1h. Gold wire contacts were attached to the bars, which then were cured at 850°C for 1h. The conductivity of the samples was measured under a redox cycle at 900°C. Low oxygen partial pressure was achieved by using a continuous flow of 5% H2/Ar.

.,"Longitudinal beam and target single-spin asymmetries have been at the center of the attention lately, since they have been measured by the HERMES and CLAS experimental Collaborations [1–4] and more measurements are planned. They were originally believed to be signals of the so-called T-odd fragmentation functions [5], in particular, of the Collins function [6–12]. However, both types of asymmetry can receive contributions also from T-odd distribution functions [13–16], a fact that has often been neglected in analyses. An exhaustive treatment of the contributions of T-odd distribution functions has not been carried out completely so far, especially up to subleading order in an expansion in 1/Q, Q2 being the virtuality of the incident photon and the only hard scale of the process, and including quark mass corrections. It is the purpose of the present work to describe the longitudinal beam and target spin asymmetries in a complete way in terms of leading and subleading twist distribution and fragmentation functions. We consider both single-particle inclusive DIS, e+p→e′+h+X, and single-jet inclusive DIS, e+p→e′+jet+X. We assume factorization holds for these processes, even though at present there is no factorization proof for observables containing subleading-twist transverse-momentum dependent functions (only recently proofs for the leading-twist case have been presented in Refs. [17,18]).

.,"MINERAL (MINeral ERror AnaLysis) is a new MATLAB® based program that provides mineral formula recalculations combined with the associated propagation of the analytical uncertainties. Methods are based on the work of Giamarita and Day (1990). However, additional features have been added to provide users with greater flexibility in data reporting. Many programs exist to recalculate wt% data into formula unit cations. Some generalized programs can be used to recalculate the formula of multiple minerals e.g. CALCMIN (Brandelik, 2009) and HYPER-FORM (De Bjerg et al., 1992). Other programs are mineral specific e.g. AMPH CLASS (Esawi, 2004) and PROBE AMPH (Tindle and Webb, 1994) for the recalculation of amphibole analyses; ILMAT (Lepage, 2003) for the recalculation of magnetite and ilmenite; and PX-NOM (Sturm, 2002) for the recalculation of pyroxene analyses. MINERAL provides a rapid method for the recalculation of multiple common minerals. However, its strength lies in the fact that is the first tool to incorporate the associated uncertainty propagation calculations. As these are performed concurrently with the standard recalculations, no additional time is needed to perform uncertainty propagation. While an understanding of the underlying calculations is strongly recommended, MINERAL is designed to allow users with little or no experience operating MATLAB® and/or performing mineral formula recalculations and uncertainty propagation to undertake both with ease.

.,"The boundary element method (BEM) has clear advantages when applied to shape optimisation of high-voltage devices, see [4–8] for an introduction to BEM. First of all, BEM relies only on a surface discretisation so that there is no need to maintain an analysis-suitable volume discretisation during the shape optimisation process. Moreover, BEM is ideal for solving problems in unbounded domains that occur in electrostatic field analysis. In gradient-based shape optimisation the shape derivative of the cost functional with respect to geometry perturbations is needed [9–11]. To this purpose, we use the adjoint approach and solve the primary and the adjoint boundary value problems with BEM. The associated linear systems of equations are dense and an acceleration technique, such as the fast multipole method [12,13], is necessary for their efficient solution. For some recent applications of fast BEM in shape optimisation and Bernoulli-type free-boundary problems we refer to [14–16].

.,"The thermodynamics of copper-zinc alloys (brass) was subject of numerous investigations. Brass is characterised by an excess enthalpy and excess entropy of mixing, both of which are negative. The enthalpic data were measured by solution calorimetry e.g., [1–3] and based on chemical potential data calculated from phase equilibrium experiments e.g., [4–6], the excess entropy of mixing could be evaluated e.g., [7–9]. This excess entropy contains both, the vibrational and the configurational parts. The excess vibrational entropy, defined as the deviation from the entropy of a mechanical mixture of the end members A and B (i.e., Smmechmix=XASmA+XBSmB), can be determined by measuring the low temperature heat capacity (5 to 300K) versus composition behaviour. The determination of the excess configurational entropy, i.e., the excess entropy coming from non-random atomic distributions and defects, is much more difficult. Here, neutron scattering investigations together with computer simulations are normally used. If, however, reliable data of the total excess entropy (from enthalpic and chemical potential data) are available, the measurement of the excess vibrational entropy enables the determination of the excess configurational entropy simply by subtraction. Since configurational and vibrational entropies may have different temperature dependencies, it is worthwhile to separate the entropic effects. This is one aim of this study. Another aim is to deliver experimental data so that first principles studies can test their models on a disordered alloy, whose structural details (short-range order) depend on temperature.

.,"After all micro elements reach a relaxed steady-state, measurements are obtained using a cumulative averaging technique to reduce noise. Each micro element is divided into spatially-oriented bins in the y-direction in order to resolve the velocity and shear-stress profiles. Velocity in each bin is measured using the Cumulative Averaging Method (CAM) [24], while the stress tensor field is measured using the Irving–Kirkwood relationship [25]. A least-squares polynomial fit to the data is performed, which helps reduce noise further. The fit produces a continuous function that avoids stability issues arising from supplying highly fluctuating data to the macro solver. A least-squares fit is applied to an Nth order polynomial for the velocity profile in the core region, and an Mth order polynomial for the velocity profile in the constrained region:(16)〈ui,core〉=∑k=1Nbk,iyi′(N−k),for 0⩽yi′⩽hcore, and(17)〈ui,cs〉=∑k=1Mck,iyi″(M−k),for 0⩽yi″⩽hcs, where bk,i and ck,i are the coefficients of the polynomials used in the core micro region and constrained region respectively.

Detailed information about the material and the stamp fabrication can be found in our earlier paper [16]. The UNCD wafer was scribed into 1×1cm2 samples and subjected to RCA cleaning (SC-1), followed by ultrasonic solvent cleaning. Nanofeature stamps were then created from the samples using conventional electron beam lithography (EBL) with negative tone electron sensitive resist, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). An Al discharge layer was required above the resist to prevent e-beam deflection due to charge build-up on the surface [17]. Several stamps were produced with this process and the pattern written varied in design but consisted of arrays of circular pillars. After EBL and HSQ development, the HSQ was used as an etch mask for RIE with a mixture of oxygen and argon gas. The etched diamond nanopillars were typically 225nm high.

It has been suggested by Bersuker et al., who used molecular models, that electrons can be trapped by Si–O bonds in a-SiO2 leading to their weakening and thus facilitating Si–O bond dissociation [16]. Further calculations by Camellone et al. have shown that electrons can spontaneously trap in non-defective continuum random network model of a-SiO2 [17]. Recent calculations have also demonstrated that the two dominant neutral paramagnetic defects at surfaces of a-SiO2, the non-bridging oxygen centre and the silicon dangling bond, are deep electron traps and can form the corresponding negatively charged defects [18]. However, these theoretical predictions have not yet been confirmed experimentally, emphasising the challenges for identifying defect centres.

.,"Two-state models are often insufficient to fit complex traces, therefore we also study the approximate fitting of large M3PPs. In the single class setting, a known limitation of MMPPs is the inability to simultaneously fit many statistical descriptors due to the non-linearity of their underlying equations (Bodrog, Heindl, Horváth, & Telek, 2008; Heindl, Horváth, & Gross, 2006; Horváth & Telek, 2009). This has led to the definition of several approaches to fit complex traces by composing multiple small-sized MMPPs or MAPs using Kronecker operators (Andersen & Nielsen, 1998; Casale, Zhang, & Smirni, 2010; Horváth & Telek, 2002). These methods employ composition operators for moment fitting, offering a different trade-off between computational cost and fitting accuracy compared to fitting methods based on the EM algorithm (Breuer, 2002; Horváth & Okamura, 2013; Klemm, Lindemann, & Lohmann, 2003). In particular, the superposition operator allows one to describe a trace by the statistical multiplexing of several MMPPs, at the expense of an exponential growth of the number of states in the resulting process (Sriram & Whitt, 1986). This state space explosion is an obstacle for the application of MMPPs and MAPs to modeling real systems; for example it considerably slows down, or even renders infeasible, the numerical evaluation of queueing models by matrix geometric methods (Bini, Meini, Steffé, Pérez, & Houdt, 2012; Pérez, Velthoven, & Houdt, 2008).

.,"The measurements presented here provide evidence for the existence of di-cluster structures in 10–12,14Be. Certainly, if the breakup process samples the overlap between the wavefunctions of the ground state and the excited states, the first-chance cluster breakup cross-sections, shown in Fig. 4(a), indicate that the xHe+A−xHe cluster structure does not decrease over the mass range A=10, 12 and 14. Given also that the decay energy threshold increases with mass number, the present data may even indicate a slight increase in clustering. The breakup cross-sections also appear to demonstrate that these nuclei possess a stronger structural overlap with an α–Xn–α configuration, although the reaction mechanics by which this final state is reached may be complex. That is to say that the dominant structural mode of the neutron rich isotopes may be identified with two alpha-particles plus valence neutrons. These comprehensive measurements of the neutron-removal and cluster breakup for the first time provide experimental data whereby the structure of the most neutron-rich Be isotopes can be modeled via their reactions.

.,"One of the great successes of the experimental program carried out at LEP has been to put a firm lower bound on the Higgs mass, mH>114 GeV [1], and at the same time, together with the information coming from SLD, to give a strong indirect evidence that the Higgs boson, the still missing particle of the Standard Model (SM), should be relatively light with a high probability for its mass to be below 200 GeV. The search for the Higgs boson is one of the main objective of the Tevatron and the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC), that are supposed to span all the Higgs mass regions up to 1 TeV. At hadron colliders the main Higgs production mechanism is the gluon fusion [2], a process whose knowledge is fundamental in order to put limits on the Higgs mass or, in case the Higgs is discovered, to compare the measured cross section with the SM result. Concerning the Higgs decay channels, it is quite difficult for an hadron collider to access part of the mass range favored by the LEP results, the so-called intermediate Higgs mass region 114≲mH≲160 GeV, because of the large QCD background to the dominant modes.

This involves Strang splitting but the first implicit stage is cleverly re-used from the final implicit stage of the previous time-step and so there is only one implicit solution per time-step. Another novel approach taken by Ullrich and Jablonowski [23] is to use a Rosenbrock solution in order to treat all of the vertical terms implicitly rather than just the terms involved in wave propagation. A Rosenbrock solution is one iteration of a Newton solver. This circumvents the time-step restriction associated with vertical advection at the cost of slowing the vertical advection.

Secondly, the different forwarding modes introduced in Section  3.3 express different levels of cooperation across the network.

.,"The class of steels known as oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic alloys (also known as nanostructured ferritic alloys) consist of a dispersion of ultra-fine oxide particles throughout the matrix. These oxide particles serve to improve the mechanical properties of the system, particularly at high temperatures, of the system through inhibiting dislocation motion and grain boundary sliding. In nuclear applications the oxide particles have been suggested to act as point defect sinks [10,11] to improve radiation tolerance, and as preferential sites for the formation of nano-scale He bubbles therefore reducing swelling compared to non-ODS steels [12–15]. The ability of the oxide particles to improve these properties depends on the structure and composition of the particles [10,11,16,17] and their stability under irradiation. Typical compositions of ODS steels include between 9 and 14at.% Cr for oxidation resistance (most commonly 14at.%); W for solid solution hardening; Y2O3 that is put into solid solution during the initial, mechanical alloying, process but then during consolidation at high temperatures forms precipitates; and Ti to inhibit significant growth of the oxide particles; the balance being made up of Fe and impurities [18]. For this reason these steels are often referred to as 14YWT, reflecting the constituent elements.

.,"Hydrides, once precipitated in zirconium, degrade the mechanical properties of a component, leading to reductions in tensile strength, ductility and fracture toughness [35–40]. These changes can ultimately compromise the integrity of cladding during normal operating life , accident conditions and fuel storage [13]. As well as the degradation of mechanical properties, the presence of hydrides can also affect phenomena like pellet cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI); or introduce mechanisms for failure, such as delayed hydride cracking (DHC). The former mechanism is the product of thermal expansion in fuel pellets introducing stresses into the cladding, which may then lead to the formation of cracks in areas made brittle by large hydride concentrations [13]. The latter mechanism, DHC, is a sub-critical, time dependent cracking phenomenon that requires long range hydrogen diffusion for repeated local hydride growth and fracture at a hydrostatic tensile stress raiser [5,41,42]. The process occurs over an extended period of time under a continuously applied load that is below the yield stress of the material [5,41,42].

.,"The next important step might be the derivation of the Dirac equation. The Creutz model  [32] suggests that we should consider incorporating into the logical inference treatment, the additional knowledge that one has objects hopping on a lattice instead of particles moving in a space-time continuum. Recall that up to Section  2.4, the description of the measurement scenario, robustness etc. is explicitly discrete. In Section  2.4, the continuum limit was taken only because our aim was to derive the Pauli equation, which is formulated in continuum space-time. Of course, the description of the motion of the particle in Section  2.6 is entirely within a continuum description but there is no fundamental obstacle to replace this treatment by a proper treatment of objects hopping on a lattice. Therefore it seems plausible that the logical inference approach can be extended to describe massless spin-1/2 particles moving in continuum space-time by considering the continuum limit of the corresponding lattice model. An in-depth, general treatment of this problem is beyond the scope of the present paper and we therefore leave this interesting problem for future research.

.,"In previous publications the present authors proposed a method to incorporate the thermodynamics of ternary alloys and liquid diffusion-governed solidification kinetics into a multiphase volume average solidification model [23,24]. Back diffusion was disregarded. A way to access the thermodynamic data (e.g. Thermo-Calc [1]) through a tabulation and interpolation program ISAT (In Situ Adaptive Tabulation) was suggested. With the ISAT approach it is possible to perform an online call of the thermodynamic data and trace the formation of each individual solid phase (primary, peritectic, eutectic, etc.). As the number of calls of the thermodynamic data is equal to the product of the number of the discretized volume elements, the time steps and the calculation iterations per time step, the calculation becomes exhausting. Therefore, the current model is a modification of the previous model using a linearized phase diagram, and no online call of thermodynamic data is necessary. In addition, the model presented in this paper is extended to consider the back diffusion into the solid. With these modifications, the model can be used to perform casting process simulations with incorporated full diffusion-governed solidification kinetics for ternary alloys at a reasonable computation cost.

.,"It is critical to the success of the NPD technique that the MOF complex adsorbs a significant amount of D2 to boost the observed signal. This technique therefore has disadvantages when studying the binding interaction within MOFs with low uptakes. Furthermore, static crystallographic studies cannot provide insights into the dynamics of the adsorbed gas molecules. Thus, it is very challenging to probe experimentally the H2 binding interactions within a porous host system which has very low gas uptake due to the lack of suitable characterisation techniques. We report herein the application of the in situ inelastic neutron scattering (INS) technique to permit direct observation of the dynamics of the binding interactions between adsorbed H2 molecules and an aluminium-based porous MOF, NOTT-300, exhibiting moderate porosity, narrow pore window and very low uptake of H2. This neutron spectroscopy study reveals that adsorbed H2 molecules do not interact with the organic ligand within the pore channels, and form very weak interactions with [Al(OH)2O4] moieties via a type of through-spacing interaction (Al-O⋯H2). Interestingly, the very low H2 adsorption has been successfully characterised as weak binding interactions and, for the first time, we have found that the adsorbed H2 in the pore channel has a liquid type recoil motion at 5K (below its melting point) as a direct result of this weak interaction to the MOF host.

.,"RemarkThe purely radiative spacetimes used as reference solutions in our analysis are not perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime. A way of seeing this is to consider the Newman–Penrose constants of the spacetime. The Newman–Penrose constants are a set of absolutely conserved quantities defined as integrals of certain components of the Weyl tensor and the Maxwell fields over cuts of null infinity—see [19–21] for the Einstein–Maxwell case. In [22] it has been shown that the value of the Newman–Penrose constants for a vacuum radiative spacetime coincides with the value of the rescaled Weyl spinor at i+—this result can be extended to the electrovacuum case using the methods of this article. For the radiative spacetimes arising from the construction of [17] it can be seen that the value of the Weyl spinor at i+ is essentially the mass quadrupole of the seed static spacetime. It follows, that the Newman–Penrose constants of the radiative spacetime can take arbitrary values. On the other hand, for the Minkowski spacetime, the Newman–Penrose constants are exactly zero, and those of perturbations thereof will be small. Thus, in this precise sense, our radiative spacetimes are, generically, not perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime, unless all the Newman–Penrose constants vanish.

.,"I also could not resist mentioning another wild speculation [10]. Many years ago, inspired by the almost exact correspondence between Einstein's post-Newtonian equations of gravity and Maxwell's equations of motion I proposed the gravitipole in analogy with Dirac's magnetic monopole. After Dirac there was considerable debate on how a field theory of magnetic monopoles may be formulated. Eventually, 't Hooft and Polyakov showed that the magnetic monopole exists as an extended solution in certain non-abelian gauge theories. Most theorists now believe that electromagnetism is merely a piece of a grand unified theory and that magnetic monopoles exist. Might it not turn out that Einstein's theory is but a piece of a bigger theory and that gravitipoles exist? In grand unified theory the electromagnetic field is a component of a multiplet. Could it be that the gravitational field also somehow carries an internal index and that the field we observe is just a component of a multiplet? Throwing caution to the wind, I also asked in [10] if the gravitipole and the graviton might not form a representation under some dual group just as the magnetic monopole and the photon form a triplet under the dual group of Montonen and Olive [11].

.,"The next phase of our current study is to use the parameters obtained from pure-component systems in a transferable manner to represent the corresponding mixtures. Mixtures of n-alkanes and H2O have been studied previously with SAFT-γ SW [82]. In general it is well known that the extreme nature of the phase separation [150] makes it challenging to model mixtures of H2O with non-polar compounds. Because of the large differences in the dielectric constant of the two phases as well as in the dipole moment of H2O and the hydrophobic molecules, it especially difficult to obtain phase-independent unlike interaction parameters [112] and thus to model simultaneously the equilibrium phases. In previous work [82], emphasis was placed on obtaining an accurate description of the alkane-rich phases (both liquid and vapour), while small absolute (but not relative) deviations for the aqueous phase composition were achieved. The systems of interest in our current work are typically aqueous mixtures containing a high proportion of H2O, alkylamine, and CO2. Consequently, in order to provide an improved overall description of the fluid-phase equilibria at the conditions of interest, refinements have been made to the unlike parameters presented in the previous study [129] relating to the interactions between H2O and the alkyl groups, CH3 and CH2, namely ϵCH3,H2O, ϵCH2,H2O and λCH3,H2O, λCH2,H2O.

nan,"The exponential relationships reported in the plots may be used to convert the dielectric values to air void values as prescribed in previous studies [1–3]. The AC pavement composite permittivity reduces, along with the reflection coefficient, as the volumetric proportion of air increases as compared to the remaining components. However, the method relies on an empirical fit, determined on a case-by-case basis, since the permittivity of the remaining components depends on the mix design (aggregate type, binder content, etc.). Long term studies in Finland concluded that this empirical fit is an exponential relationship [1]. The exponential fits, using a sufficient amount of cores, can be used to map the air void content variation in a similar manner to the dielectric maps shown in Fig. 4. Only 4 cores were feasible due to various factors involved with testing the final lift of an in-service pavement. More cores are needed for more stable exponential coefficients, although the limited cores show that the predicted relationships are similar for the measured dielectric range in this case-study. Since both regressions predict air void content at a maximum difference of 0.56%, which is within the uncertainty of the core measurement precision of 0.7%, use of either the initial or repeat run regression predictions are appropriate.

nan,"In conclusion, a new approach to the “grind-free” nanoprecursor route to direct combinatorial solid state synthesis of several “difficult to make” and hitherto unknown phase-pure heterometallic Ruddlesden Popper type La4Ni3−xFexO10 materials has been described. The new approach used a high-throughput reactor and robotic automation (RAMSI) to rapidly synthesise a range of nanoparticle co-precipitate precursors in cloned libraries at a rate of 7.5 samples an hour. Each library could then be heat-treated at a different temperature and an initial powder XRD screen was used to locate and approximate phase boundary. A more focussed second synthesis and XRD characterisation of selected larger heat-treated powders was then performed to reconfirm the locations of the phase boundaries with the highest dopant level being achieved for La4Ni2FeO10 which is significantly greater Fe doping than has been achieved by anyone previously (despite several notable efforts). EXAFS data suggested that Fe3+ was located onto Ni sites in all cases and did not exist as a separate iron oxide phase.

nan,"Ever since the identification of the paramagnetic E′ centre in SiO2 as an unpaired electron localised in an sp3 hybrid orbital of an Si atom backbonded to three oxygen atoms, a number of attempts has been made at explaining the optical and electronic properties of SiO2 in the presence of E′ centres. The irradiation or hole injection induces trapping of positive charge in thin layers of a-SiO2 grown on silicon surfaces by thermal oxidation. This effect has been correlated with paramagnetic E′ centre signals and led to the initial assignment of the neutral oxygen vacancy as the major hole trap in a-SiO2 [1–3]. In this model, originally proposed for E′ centres in α-quartz, upon trapping a hole, one Si atom from the two Si atoms constituting the vacancy remains neutral and hosts the localised unpaired electron while its counterpart becomes positively charged. Although this model has initially been accepted widely for its simplicity, it fails to account for a number of observations, such as the positive charge trapping without generation of E′ centres [4], the formation of high density of E′ centres without the corresponding density of positive charge [5], and the absence of correlation between the decrease of the E′ centre density and the density of positive charge upon post-irradiation electron injection in SiO2 [6].

The present DEA methods rely on the fact that one can easily parametrise the boundary of the region being modelled, and then apply an orthonormal basis approximation over the resulting boundary phase space coordinate system. In two dimensions this is simple as the boundary may be parametrised along its arc-length and the associated momentum (or direction) coordinate taken tangential to the boundary. The basis can be any suitable (scaled) univariate basis in both position and momentum, such as a Fourier basis [8] or Chebyshev polynomials [9]. Defining a suitable parametrisation for the spatial coordinate in three-dimensions becomes much more difficult. In momentum space spherical polar coordinates may be employed and so these problems do not arise.

nan,"A limitation of the pharmacyte approach is the one-time nature of the intervention: ACT T-cells can only be loaded once with a cargo of adjuvant drug prior to transfer, and the duration of stimulation is inherently limited by expansion of the cell population in vivo, since cell-bound particles are diluted with each cell division. We hypothesized that a strategy to target supporting drugs to T-cells with nanoparticle drug carriers directly in vivo would enable transferred lymphocytes to be repeatedly stimulated with supporting adjuvant drugs, and thereby provide continuous supporting signals over the prolonged durations that might be necessary for elimination of large tumor burdens. Such “re-arming” of T-cells with supporting drugs could be achieved by repeated administration of targeted particles, allowing adoptively-transferred T-cells to be restimulated multiple times directly in vivo, while the use of internalizing targeting ligands would minimize the likelihood of immune responses against the nanoparticle carrier. To our knowledge, only two prior studies have attempted to target nanoparticles to T-cells in vivo [17,18]. In both of these studies, particles were targeted to T-cells via peptide-MHC ligands that bind to specific T-cell receptors. However, peptide-MHC-functionalized nanoparticles have recently been shown to deliver an anergizing/tolerizing signal to T-cells [18,19] — which is ideal for treating graft rejection or autoimmunity, but runs counter to the goals of cancer immunotherapy.

nan,"As the progression towards smaller lithographic nodes continues it has become necessary to adopt thinner resist films to mitigate problems such as pattern collapse. To address the issue of reduced etch resistance of thin photoresist films the semiconductor industry has begun to develop multilayer processes where the pattern is first transferred into an intermediate organic hardmask with higher etch selectivity before final silicon pattern transfer [25–27]. In this paper we demonstrate how the introduction of such a multilayer process can also benefit nanosphere lithography by increasing achievable aspect ratios of silicon nanopillars without the need for complex etch processes requiring specialised and expensive equipment, but instead needing only a standard SF6/C4F8 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mixed mode etch process at room temperature [28]. As intermediate layer material we used polyimide, which finds widespread use as encapsulation material for IC production. It is readily patterned in oxygen plasma and has a lower etch rate than silicon in SF6 gas. Its flexibility can also be used for the fabrication of soft polymer pillars by the same process as we will show. The multilayer process slightly increases the complexity of sample preparation but allows basic ICP etching to achieve high aspect ratio structures at smaller feature sizes that previously reported without the need for complex etching equipment.

nan,"Ultrasound (US) can initiate the release of drugs from liposomes via an event called inertial cavitation, whereby the rarefactional phase of an ultrasound wave causes the expansion of a gas bubble followed by a violent collapse due to the inertia of the surrounding media. This collapse creates shock waves which can disrupt the stability of co-localised liposomal drug carriers. To date, studies have concentrated on the use of low frequency or high intensity US to generate gas bubbles in situ, and most recently such parameters have been used to achieve a variable level of triggered drug release following an intratumoral injection of liposomes [14]. However, concerns persist over the damage to non-target tissue that such US exposure parameters may cause and whether ultimately they will be widely clinically applicable. An alternative strategy is to utilise high-frequency US pulses at pressures in the diagnostic range in the presence of pre-existing gas bubbles. This provides an inertial cavitation stimulus for drug release using safe, clinically achievable US exposure conditions and approved US contrast agents [15]. Indeed, in the context of improving the delivery of therapeutics such as oncolytic viruses, this approach has already shown great promise [16]. A further advantage of this approach is that US-induced cavitation events produce distinct acoustic emissions that can be recorded and characterised providing non-invasive feedback, a feature which has proven useful in ablative US applications [17–19].

nan,"Gas sorption, storage and separation in carbon materials are mainly based on physisorption on the surfaces and particularly depend on the electrostatic and dispersion (i.e., vdW) interactions. The former can be tuned by introducing charge variations in the material, and the latter by chemical substitution. The strength of the interaction is determined by the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and the properties of targeted adsorbate molecule, including but not limited to the size and shape of the adsorbate molecule along with its polarizability, magnetic susceptibility, permanent dipole moment, and quadrupole moment. Li et al. summarise the adsorption-related physical parameters of many gas or vapour adsorbates, and herein Table 1 we show a few of those of interest, H2, N2, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, SO2 and H2S [90]. For instance, an adsorbent with a high specific surface area is a good candidate for adsorption of a molecule with high polarizability but no polarity. Adsorbents with highly polarised surfaces are good for adsorbate molecules with a high dipole moment. The adsorbents with high electric field gradient surfaces are found to be ideal for the high quadrupole moment adsorbate molecules [91]. Normally, the binding or adsorption strength with a carbon nanostructure is relatively low for H2 and N2; intermediate for CO, CH4 and CO2; and relatively high for H2S, NH3 and H2O. Thus, surface modifications, such as doping, functionalization and improving the pore structure and specific surface area of nanocarbons, are important to enhance gas adsorption. For this purpose, graphene offers a great scope for tailor-made carbonaceous adsorbents.

nan,"The microwave background is not the only universal photon field that has to be taken in consideration. Especially interesting is the isotropic infrared and optical background (IRB). The number density of IRB is smaller than that of MBR by more that two orders of magnitude. On the other hand, protons of lower energy can interact on the IRB, and the smaller number density has to be weighted with the higher flux of interacting protons. The present Universe is optically thin to 1019 eV and lower energy protons, but even at low redshifts the proton interaction rate quickly increases. This is different from the interactions on MBR, where the interacting protons quickly lose their energy even at z=0. The cosmological evolution of UHECR injection is thus of major importance for the contribution of such interactions to the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos.

nan,"Zirconium alloys are commonly used as the fuel cladding for water cooled nuclear fission reactors, mainly due to their low neutron cross-section, good corrosion resistance during normal operating conditions and sufficient mechanical strength [1]. Despite high corrosion resistance at normal operating temperatures (around 300 °C) [2], Zr alloys oxidise very rapidly when exposed to temperatures a few hundred degrees higher. This is an exothermic reaction, which can further accelerate oxidation and, at temperatures beyond 1000 °C, potentially lead to disintegration of the fuel rods, as highlighted during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. For this reason new research activities have been initiated worldwide to develop accident tolerant fuels (ATF). Additionally, ATFs could also provide further enhancements in corrosion performance during normal operating conditions enabling the development of fuel assemblies for very high burn-up.

nan,"Complex Langevin (CL) dynamics  [1,2] provides an approach to circumvent the sign problem in numerical simulations of lattice field theories with a complex Boltzmann weight, since it does not rely on importance sampling. In recent years a number of stimulating results has been obtained in the context of nonzero chemical potential, in both lower and four-dimensional field theories with a severe sign problem in the thermodynamic limit  [3–8] (for two recent reviews, see e.g. Refs.  [9,10]). However, as has been known since shortly after its inception, correct results are not guaranteed  [11–16]. This calls for an improved understanding, relying on the combination of analytical and numerical insight. In the recent past, the important role played by the properties of the real and positive probability distribution in the complexified configuration space, which is effectively sampled during the Langevin process, has been clarified  [17,18]. An important conclusion was that this distribution should be sufficiently localised in order for CL to yield valid results. Importantly, this insight has recently also led to promising results in nonabelian gauge theories, with the implementation of SL(N,C) gauge cooling  [8,10].

The database provided with WASI has been derived from in-situ measurements from lakes in Southern Germany (Gege, 1998; Heege, 2000; Pinnel, 2007). If no site-specific information is available, it can be used as a first approximation for other ecosystems as well. The variability within an ecosystem can be as large as between different ecosystem, i.e. ecosystem-specific sets of optical properties do not exist. However, region or season specific information should be used whenever available. Ideally, the optical properties should be measured at the test site close to the airplane or satellite overpass. This is however not always possible. A valuable source of information is the IOCCG webpage (IOCCG, 2013b).

nan,"Some methods use 1D radial profiles obtained from circular averaging of 2D experimental PSD [4,8,11] or by elliptical averaging [17]. An inadequacy of circular averaging is that it neglects astigmatism. Astigmatism distorts the circular shape of the Thon rings and thus decreases their modulation depth in the obtained 1D profile. A few algorithms that consider astigmatism involve concepts such as dividing the PSD into sectors where Thon rings are approximated by circular arcs [15,21], applying Canny edge detection to find the rings [17] prior to elliptical averaging, determining the relationship between the 1D circular averages with and without astigmatism [22], or using a brute-force scan of a database containing precalculated patterns as in ATLAS [23]. Some other approaches for estimating CTF parameters do a fully 2D PSD optimization [12,14,18,20] but they usually regulate and fit numerous parameters by an extensive search that does not guarantee convergence. Furthermore, only a few schemes that were developed for defocus estimation provide an error analysis [23,24].

nan,"Following fission, noble gas atoms will be distributed in the fuel matrix initially accommodated at point defects trap sites, generally thought to be Schottky trivacancy defects [4,5,31]. Diffusion to either bubbles or grain boundaries is then facilitated by associating a further uranium vacancy defect for the gas atom to ‘hop’ into, with the original vacancy then able to loop around to ensure continued diffusion. The rate determining step in the process is not the migration of the Xe itself but rather the rearrangement of the VU defect to facilitate net Xe diffusion [6–8]. Activation energies for the overall process depend on the availability of the defect trap sites, which in turn depends on the crystal stoichiometry. For Xe diffusion in UO2−x, UO2 and UO2+x the activation energies calculated using DFT are 7.04–12.92 eV, 4.15–7.88 eV and 1.38–4.07 eV with the ranges reflecting the way the calculations were performed depending on the charge states of the defects involved and the presence of a Jahn–Teller distortion [7]. Activation energies calculated using empirical pair potentials can vary strongly depending on the choice of potential. Govers et al. examined three different potentials for UO2 (those of Basak [9], Jackson [10] and Morelon [11]) coupled with different parameterisations for the U–Xe and O–Xe interactions from Geng [12] and Nicoll [13] and recommend values of 6.5 eV, 4.5 eV and 2.4 eV [6] for the different stoichiometric regimes in very good agreement with the experimental values of 6.0 eV, 3.9 eV and 1.7 eV respectively [14].

nan,"Thin MIEC layers of GDC and STFO on single-crystalline YSZ substrates were exposed to H2/H218O atmosphere for thermally and electrochemically driven tracer exchange experiments. Rectangular noble metal thin film current collectors were deposited on top and beneath the MIEC layer and used for polarization. The lateral distribution of the tracer revealed several interesting features: (i) In case of thermal tracer exchange, an enhanced tracer fraction is found on top of the metallic current collector due to its ionically blocking nature. At the edges of the current collector, the concentration of 18O decreases with a finite step width that is correlated with in-plane diffusion of oxygen ions. (ii) Due to the low electronic conductivity of STFO and GDC, the MIEC area that is influenced by an applied bias is restricted to a region close to the current collector. The width of this active region depends on the bias. It amounts to only 10–15μm for STFO but more than 100μm for GDC at a cathodic bias of −500mV. (iii) Not only enhanced tracer incorporation due to cathodic bias but also reduced incorporation due to anodic bias could be experimentally resolved in the active region.

nan,"States outside the constituent quark model have been hypothesized to exist almost since the introduction of color [1–4]. Hybrid mesons, qq̄ states with an admixture of gluons, and glueballs, states with no quark content, rely on the self interaction property of gluons due to their color charge. Looking for glueballs would be the most obvious way to find evidence for states with constituent gluons; however, the search is hindered by the fact that these states may significantly mix with regular qq̄-mesons in the region where the lightest are predicted to occur. As such, they may not be observable as pure states and disentangling the observed spectra may be a very difficult task. Instead, hybrid mesons (qq̄gn) may be a better place to search for evidence of resonances outside the constituent quark model, especially since the lightest of theses states are predicted to have exotic quantum numbers of spin, parity, and charge conjugation, JPC, that is, combinations that are unattainable by regular qq̄-mesons.

nan,"The control of the RP re-encounter probability finds a direct application to improve the performance of chemical devices. Here, we show how a simple-to-implement control scheme highly enhances the sensitivity of a model chemical magnetometer by up to two orders of magnitude. The basic idea behind a chemical magnetometer is that, since a change in the magnetic field modifies the amount of singlet products, one can reverse the reasoning and measure the chemical yield to estimate B. Intuitively, the magnetic sensitivity is high when a small change in the magnetic field intensity produces large effects on the singlet yield. Formally, it is defined as:(2)Λs(B)≡∂Φs(B)∂B=∫0∞pre(t)gs(B,t)dt,with gs(B,t)≡∂fs(B,t)∂B being the instantaneous magnetic sensitivity. The functional form of fs(B,t)=Sρel(t)S strongly depends on the specific realization of the radical pair, in particular on the number of the surrounding nuclear spins. Here, we consider a radical pair in which the first electron spin is devoid of hyperfine interactions, while the second electron spin interacts isotropically with one spin-1 nucleus, e.g. nitrogen. In the context of the chemical compass (i.e. when the task is determining the magnetic field direction through anisotropic hyperfine interactions), an analogous configuration (with only one spin-1/2 nucleus) has been proposed [3], and numerically characterized [8], as being optimal: Additional nuclear spins would perturb the intuitive ‘reference and probe’ picture.

nan,"Recently, fundamental (thermophysical property) research on ionic clathrate hydrates has experienced remarkable growth, particularly over the last ten years [21–30]. Previously, beginning with the first paper on unusual hydrates of tetrabutylammonium salts in 1940 [31], a number of studies could be found on ionic clathrate hydrates (hereafter, semiclathrate hydrates) [32–35] before the unified terminology semiclathrate hydrate was generally accepted. Semiclathrate hydrates have been attracting increased attention because of their promising applications as phase change materials for refrigeration systems and in gas capture and storage [36–41]. In addition, there is interesting speculation that semiclathrate hydrate may be regarded as a representative substance for the study of thermal conductivity in clathrate hydrate in general. This is because: (1) it can reduce characterization problems as a solid sample, since semiclathrate hydrate is formed around ambient temperature under atmospheric pressure and is easy to handle; (2) accurately measuring the thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates, which have many similarities to clathrate hydrates, may make possible a deeper understanding of the unique (anomalous) behavior of the thermal conductivity of clathrate hydrates; and (3) currently, there are no experimental studies on the thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates.

First, we shall present a concise analysis of the lepton mass matrices in Table 1 and reveal their isomeric features, namely, they have the same phenomenological consequences, although their structures are apparently different. Second, we shall examine the predictions of these lepton mass matrices by comparing them with the 2σ and 3σ intervals of two neutrino mass-squared differences and three lepton flavor mixing angles,22To be specific, we make use of the 2σ and 3σ intervals of two neutrino mass-squared differences and three lepton flavor mixing angles given by M. Maltoni et al. in Ref. [5]. which are obtained from a global analysis of the latest solar, atmospheric, reactor (KamLAND and CHOOZ [10]) and accelerator (K2K) neutrino data. We find no parameter space allowed for six isomeric lepton mass matrices at the 2σ level. At the 3σ level, however, their results for neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing angles can be compatible with current data. Third, we incorporate the seesaw mechanism and the Fukugita–Tanimoto–Yanagida hypothesis [9] in the charged lepton and Dirac neutrino mass matrices with six texture zeros. It turns out that their predictions, including θ23≈45°, are in good agreement with the present experimental data even at the 2σ level.

nan,"In this article we consider an extension to the equations of poroelasticity by modelling the flow of a slightly compressible single phase fluid in a viscoelastic porous medium. The constitutive equations therefore allow for the presence of viscoelastic relaxation effects in the porous media (but not the fluid). Fully discrete numerical schemes are derived based on a lagged and non-lagged backward Euler time stepping method applied to a mixed and Galerkin finite element spatial discretization. We show that the lagged scheme is unconditionally stable and give an optimal a priori error bound for it. Furthermore, this scheme is practical and useful in the sense that it can be easily implemented in existing poroelasticity software because the coupling between the viscous stresses and pressures and the elasticity and flow equations is ‘lagged’ by one time step. The required additional coding therefore takes the form of extra ‘right hand side loads’ together with some updating subroutines for the viscoelastic internal variables, but the solver and assembly engines remain intact. This idea of lagging has been used before for nonlinearly viscoelastic diffusion problems in [3,24] but, of course, is not new. Lagging in numerical schemes is discussed more widely by Lowrie in [14].

This is performed by a finite difference scheme working on a rectangular grid in two or three dimensions. Information on normal vectors and curvature can be obtained. The fast marching method [21] provides an efficient numerical scheme of complexity nlogn to compute the support values on the grid. It is a reinterpretation of the propagation process, i.e. the time where the interface passes a certain grid point is influenced only by those neighboring grid points which are previously passed by the interface. An overview on the theory of level set and fast marching methods and their applications to problems of various areas are given in [22,23], for example shape offsetting, computing distances, photolithography development, seismic travel times, etc. Distance fields are a special case of the level set equation where the absolute value of the advection velocity is 1.

nan,"Zirconium alloys are used as fuel cladding in pressurised and boiling water nuclear reactors. As such these materials are exposed to a large number of environmental factors that will promote degradation mechanisms such as oxidation. At high burn-ups, i.e. extended service life, oxidation and the associated hydrogen pick-up can be a limiting factor in terms of fuel efficiency and safety. The oxidation kinetics for many zirconium alloys are cyclical, demonstrating a series of approximately cubic kinetic curves separated by transitions [1–5]. These transitions are typified by a breakdown in the protective character of the oxide and are potentially linked to a number of mechanical issues. Understanding how these issues influence oxidation is a key to developing a full mechanistic understanding of the corrosion process.

nan,"Copper electro-chemical deposition (ECD) of through silicon via (TSV) is a key challenge of 3D integration. This paper presents a numerical modeling of TSV filling concerning the influence of the accelerator and the suppressor. The diffusion–adsorption model was used in the simulation and effects of the additives were incorporated in the model. The boundary conditions were derived from a set of experimental Tafel curves with different concentrations of additives, which provided a quick and accurate way for copper ECD process prediction without complicated surface kinetic parameters fitting. The level set method (LSM) was employed to track the copper and electrolyte interface. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experiments. For a given feature size, the current density for superfilling could be predicted, which provided a guideline for ECD process optimization.

nan,"Within a coalescence approach as successfully applied earlier in the light-quark sector, we have evaluated transverse-momentum dependencies of charmed hadrons in central heavy-ion reactions at RHIC. For the charm-quark distributions at hadronization we have considered two limiting scenarios, i.e., no reinteractions (using spectra from PYTHIA) and complete thermalization with transverse flow of the bulk matter. The resulting J/ψ (mT-)spectra differ in slope by up to a factor of 2 (harder for pQCD c-quarks), and the integrated yield is about a factor of 3 larger in the thermal case. For D-mesons, we found that the difference in the slope parameters of the pT-spectra in the two scenarios is less pronounced, but their elliptic flow is about a factor of 2 larger for pT⩾1.5 GeV in the thermalized case. The elliptic flow pattern of D-mesons was found to be essentially preserved in the single-electron decay spectra, rendering the latter a very promising observable to address the strength of charm reinteractions in the QGP. The present study can be straightforwardly generalized to charmed baryons (Λc), which may serve as a complimentary probe for charm-quark reinteractions in the QGP.

nan,"The choice of the interpolation functions and support point coordinates for the gradient field is crucial to ensure stability and accuracy of the formulation. For example, nodal integration and NS-FEM are unstable involving the appearance of spurious low-energy modes. They need non-physical penalty energy functions that stabilize them. The articles [2,28] numerically verify the stability, convergence and accuracy of several W2 variants including new elements which can be constructed based on the idea of assumed continuous deformation gradients. For first order hexahedral elements, [2,28] found good results for the element types C3D_8N_27C and C3D_8N_8I. The first is defined by 27 support points and a second order tensor-product interpolation of the deformation gradient by Lagrange polynomials. The latter element type is defined by 16 support points with 8 points being coincident with the nodes and 8 additional points in the element interior. Among the tested first order tetrahedra, the nodally integrated tetrahedron with an additional bubble mode in the gradients was found to be most accurate. It turned out to be even the most efficient with respect to computing time in explicit analysis [28] because the enlarged critical time step compensates the slightly increased numerical cost per restoring force assembly. Fig. 1 illustrates the positions of support points for various CAG and SFEM formulations.

nan,"The vibrational spectra of l-cysteine have been recorded and assigned in both solution [8,9] and the solid state [10–14]. Spectral assignments have been made using empirical force fields [15], Hartree–Fock calculations [10,16,17] based on the isolated molecule approximation. For systems that exhibit strong intermolecular interactions, this approximation often leads to poor agreement between experiment and theory. A striking example is purine [18], where a study of the solid state vibrational spectra by isolated molecule and periodic calculations, gave almost quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for the latter, whereas the former gave only modest agreement and was unable to distinguish between the tautomers. In the present case, where the structure consists of ions linked by hydrogen bonds, periodic calculations based on the complete primitive cell are essential [19]. The only work [20] that includes some solid state effects used molecular dynamics but from which it is difficult to extract assignments. The aim of this paper is to provide a complete assignment of the vibrational spectra of l-cysteine in both the orthorhombic and monoclinic forms by the use of a combination of computational and experimental methods.

nan,"The dashed curve represents the PuO2 molar fraction on the sample surface. It shows that, following the UO2–PuO2 phase boundaries, rather well established in this compositional range (see Section 4.3 below), the newly formed liquid surface is initially enriched in plutonium dioxide. Subsequently, due to fast diffusion in the liquid phase, the initial sample composition (x(PuO2)=0.25) tends to be rapidly restored. It is however clear, from the simulation, that the fast cooling occurring after the end of the laser pulse leads to onset of solidification before the initial composition is fully recovered in the liquid. A surface solid crust forms then upon freezing before the total liquid mass has crystallised (see insets in Fig. 4). The double inflection during cooling in this case corresponds to the solidification onset on the sample surface (first inflection) and to the disappearance of the last liquid inside the material (second inflection). The highest recalescence temperature represents the solidification point of a composition very close to the initial one (approximately ±0.01 on x(PuO2) in the current example), except for small segregation effects. These latter have been studied also experimentally in the present research, by post-melting material characterisation.

nan,"This study proposes a new framework of a numerical modelling of the gas exchange between air and water across their interface, and subsequent chemical reaction in water based on an extended two-compartment model. The major purpose of this study is to provide a fundamental concept for modelling physicochemical processes of the gas exchange, followed by the chemical reaction in water. Demonstrating fundamental data and knowledge on the important environmental transport phenomena, especially the effects of the Schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms across the interface have also been attempted. The gas exchange processes are separated into two physicochemical substeps, the first is the gas–liquid equilibrium between the two phases, and the second is the chemical reaction in the water phase. A first-order, irreversible chemical reaction of the gaseous material after its uptake into the water phase is assumed here to simplify interactions of the chemical reactions and turbulent transport phenomena in water. While a traditional two-compartment model assumes uniform concentration of a material in each compartment, the present two-compartment model uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique in the water compartment to evaluate temporal development of three-dimensional profiles of the velocity and concentration fields. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach is used to evaluate profiles of fluid velocities and concentrations in water, and several important turbulence statistics have been evaluated without using turbulent closures, and subgrid-scale models. We assume that a fluid flow in the water phase is a well-developed turbulent water layer of a low Reynolds number, and the Schmidt number is varied from 1 to 8 to observe the effects of the molecular diffusion of the gas in sub-interface water on the gas exchange rate at the interface. Six degrees of the nondimensional chemical reaction rate are used to find the effect of the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms. Extrapolations of the gas exchange rates and the related transport phenomena toward larger Schmidt number and the faster chemical reaction rate will also be examined to predict the gas exchange processes of the actual gases of Sc∼O(102) based on results from the present numerical experiments.

nan,"The formulation in Table 1 was derived by an empirical approach and led to a non-classical glass matrix. Carter et al. [3] and Zhang et al. [4] took a more systematic approach to such glass-ceramic wasteforms. These wasteforms were targeted at Hanford K-basin sludges and the immobilisation of the primary waste stream from production of molybdenum-99 at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation site in Sydney respectively. In the work of Carter et al. and Zhang et al. the intended crystalline phase was the closely related titanate pyrochlore, CaUTi2O7. The glass matrix was formulated such that the trivalent species in the glass network, boron and aluminium, were charge compensated on a molar basis by sodium. The stoichiometric composition of the glass in this wasteform was Na2AlBSi6O16. This glass provides a method by which the glass composition can be varied systematically. Given that the initial observations inferred an important role played by alumina, it was decided to prepare a suite of zirconolite glass-ceramics in which the glass matrix was defined by Na2Al1+xB1–xSi6O16 to investigate the role played by glass composition in controlling crystalline phase stability. The x=1 end member gives the mineral albite, NaAlSi3O8. The melting point of albite is 1120°C [5] and the composition cools to a glass at the cooling rates that occur during a HIP cycle. From the available phase diagrams, [6] no boron analogue for albite was shown, and the liquidus estimated from the relevant phase diagram is 1100–1200°C. No phase diagrams for the quaternary system Na2O–Al2O3–B2O3–SiO2 could be found.

nan,"The Magnox reactors represent the first generation of gas-cooled reactors in the UK that used carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary coolant and a honeycomb network of graphite bricks to provide neutron moderation. During reactor operation significant amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) was produced from the CO2 coolant. This CO in turn can be radiolytically polymerised to form a carbonaceous deposit on free surfaces [12]. This non-graphitic carbon deposit is significantly more chemically reactive to air than the underlying graphite [12,13]. During the lifetime of some Magnox reactors, small quantities of methane gas were injected into the coolant gas to inhibit weight loss of the graphite core due to radiolytic oxidation [14]. Methane (CH4) is a precursor for carbonaceous deposits that form a sacrificial layer protecting the underlying graphite from excessive weight loss [15] and reduction in mechanical strength [16]. It is assumed nitrogen incorporation during deposit formation is the subsequent production route for the high 14C levels observed.

nan,"Myocardial electrical propagation can be simulated using the monodomain or bidomain PDEs [5,6]. Due to its capacity to represent complex geometries with ease, approximations are often obtained using the finite element method (FEM) to discretise the PDEs in space on realistic cardiac geometry meshes; this results in very large (up to forty-million degrees of freedom (DOF) for human heart geometries) systems of linear equations which must be solved many thousands of times over the course of even a short simulation. Thus, they are extremely computationally demanding, presenting taxing problems even to high-end supercomputing resources. This computational demand means that effort has been invested in developing efficient solution techniques, including work on preconditioning, parallelisation and adaptivity in space and time [7–12]. In this study, we investigate the potential of reducing the number of DOF by using a high-order polynomial FEM [13–15] to approximate the monodomain PDE in space, with the goal of significantly improving simulation efficiency over the piecewise-linear FEM approach commonly used in the field [16–19]. For schemes where the polynomial degree p of the elements is adjusted according to the error in the approximation, this is known as the finite element p-version. In the work presented here, we work with schemes which keep p fixed.

nan,"The primary benefit of using a 3D model is that it allows the application of anisotropic material properties. As a hexagonal close packed lattice structure, a single zirconium grain is plastically anisotropic due to the difficulty of activating slip with a 〈c〉 component [23–26]. Abaqus allows this to be represented by setting plasticity potential ratios. The anisotropic elastic and plastic constants are shown in Table 1. Zirconium alloys can often have a bimodal basal pole distribution, with a tilt on the basal normal or c direction of ±30° in the normal direction being quoted for recrystallized Zircaloy-4 [27,28]. However, for simplicity the basal normal or c direction has been taken as being parallel to the normal direction. As such the 1, 2 and 3 directions in Table 1 correlate with the X, Y and Z global coordinate system for the 3D simulations, with the 3 direction correlating to the c direction of a zirconium unit lattice. Table 1 also shows the elastic properties incorporated into the simulations. The oxide layer has been simulated as a purely elastic material. Although it is known that the oxide is strongly textured [29], it is still simulated as a homogenous solid therefore isotropic material properties have been used for the oxide in all simulations.

nan,"In situ oxidation, experiments were carried out using 3mm diameter discs with one surface ground and polished to a 1μm diamond finish. The 3mm discs were then oxidised in a Philips XL-30 FEG ESEM with a hot stage attachment. The oxidising atmosphere used was laboratory air at a pressure of 266Pa. During the experiment, the sample was observed and imaged using a primary beam energy of 20kV and an Everhart–Thornley secondary electron detector. The sample was heated at a rate of 100°C/min to a temperature of 700°C and held at this temperature for 8min to stabilise the stage and the microscope. The sample was then heated to a final temperature of 900°C at the same heating rate. The total time of exposure of the sample was 120min before cooling to room temperature by turning off the heating coils. The samples were then examined in the LEO 1530VP FEGSEM with chemical information gathered using EDS. Cross-sections and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) samples were produced using a dual beam FEI Nova Nanolab 600 for Focused Ion Beam (FIB) milling perpendicular to the phase boundaries to determine their influence on the oxide development and imaged using a Jeol 2000FX W-filament TEM.

nan,"In the supersymmetric case, such a small coupling for quartic interaction cannot be realized if the potential is lifted by the gauge D-term interactions, since, if so, the coupling constant λ becomes of the order O(g2) where g is the gauge coupling constant in the standard model. Therefore, we focus our attention on the D-flat directions. For D-flat directions, we have to be more careful since behaviors of the potential depend on which flat direction we consider. In the MSSM, Yukawa interactions exist in the superpotential to generate the fermion masses. Such Yukawa interactions lift some of the D-flat directions. In addition, we can also find several D-flat directions which are not affected by the Yukawa interactions associated with the fermion masses; without R-parity violation, such D-flat directions are only lifted by the effects of supersymmetry breaking.33Here, we assume that coefficients of non-renormalizable terms are suppressed enough to be neglected. This may be explained by the R-symmetry, assigning R-charge 23 to each MSSM chiral superfields. (See Ref. [6] for the details.)

nan,"The main objective of this manuscript is to present and discuss the application of SLAMM to the New York coast. Although the base analysis considers a range of different possible SLR scenarios, the effects of various sources of uncertainties such as input parameters and driving data are not accounted for. In addition, refined and site-specific data are often not available requiring the use of regional data collected from literature and professional judgement in order to run the model. To ignore the effects of these uncertainties on predictions may make interpretation of the results and subsequent decision making misleading since the likelihood and probabilities of predicted outcomes would be unknown. A unique capability of the current version of SLAMM is the ability to aggregate multiple types of input-data uncertainty to create outputs accompanied by probability statements and confidence intervals. Uncertainty in elevation data layers have been considered by several modeling groups to various extents (Gesch, 2009; Gilmer and Ferdaña, 2012; Schmid et al., 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, no other marsh migration model simultaneously accounts for the combined effects of uncertainty in spatial inputs (DEM, VDATUM, etc.) and parameter choices (accretion rates, tide ranges, etc.) on landcover projections. This added feature of SLAMM allows results to be evaluated in terms of their likelihood of occurrence with respect to input-data and parameter uncertainties. Further, by assigning wide ranges of uncertainty when appropriate, it permits the production of meaningful projections in areas where high-quality local data are not available.

nan,"In the recent years and mainly motivated by the impulse of data mining many methods for dimensionality reduction have arisen. Within these, it is worth highlighting the Principal Component Analysis method (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002). In an N-dimensional vector space, the simplest version of PCA (linear PCA) is a technique that finds the mutually-uncorrelated vectors onto which the projection of the samples generates the highest variances. The result is a set of orthogonal vectors sorted in descending order of achieved variance. The first of these vectors is that onto which the variance of the projection of the samples is maximum. In this sense, the original KPIs constitute the N-dimensional vector space basis, whereas the N^ synthetic KPIs represent the orthogonal vectors with the highest variance. To be rigorous, up to N synthetic orthogonal KPIs may be computed. However, only a small set of them, the first N^, is enough to account for most of the variance of the data.

nan,"Recent astronomical observations of high redshift type Ia supernovae performed by two groups [1–3] as well as the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the BOOMERANG [4] and MAXIMA-1 [5] experiments seem to indicate that at present the Universe is in a state of accelerated expansion. If one analyzes these data within the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) standard model of cosmology their most natural interpretation is that the Universe is spatially flat and that the (baryonic plus dark) matter density ρ is about one third of the critical density ρcrit. Most interestingly, the dominant contribution to the energy density is provided by the cosmological constant Λ. The vacuum energy density (1.1)ρΛ≡Λ/(8πG) is about twice as large as ρ, i.e., about two thirds of the critical density. With ΩM≡ρ/ρcrit, ΩΛ≡ρΛ/ρcrit and Ωtot≡ΩM+ΩΛ: (1.2)ΩM≈1/3,ΩΛ≈2/3,Ωtot≈1. This implies that the deceleration parameter q is approximately −1/2. While originally the cosmological constant problem [6] was related to the question why Λ is so unnaturally small, the discovery of the important role played by ρΛ has shifted the emphasis toward the “coincidence problem”, the question why ρ and ρΛ happen to be of the same order of magnitude precisely at this very moment [7].

nan,"Inverse miniemulsion polymerization is a water-in-oil (W/O) heterogeneous polymerization process that forms kinetically stable macroemulsions at, below, or around the critical micellar concentration (CMC). This process contains aqueous droplets (including water-soluble monomers) stably dispersed, with the aid of oil-soluble surfactants, in a continuous organic medium. Stable inverse miniemulsions are formed under high shear by either a homogenizer or a high speed mechanical stirrer. Oil-soluble nonionic surfactants with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value around 4 are used to implement colloidal stability of the resulting inverse emulsion. Upon addition of radical initiators, polymerization occurs within the aqueous droplets producing colloidal particles (Fig. 2) [83]. Several reports have demonstrated the preparation of stable particles of hydrophilic and water-soluble polymers [86–89], polyaniline nanoparticles [90], and organic–inorganic hybrid particles [91–93]. This method also allows for the preparation of crosslinked microgels in the presence of difunctional crosslinkers [27,94–100].

nan,"Uranium carbide was traditionally used as fuel kernel for the US version of pebble bed reactors as opposed to the German version based on uranium dioxide. For the Generation IV nuclear systems, mixed uranium–plutonium carbides (U, Pu) C constitute the primary option for the gas fast reactors (GFR) and UCO is the first candidate for the very high temperature reactor (VHTR). In the former case the fuel high actinide density and thermal conductivity are exploited in view of high burnup performance. In the latter, UCO is a good compromise between oxides and carbides both in terms of thermal conductivity and fissile density. However, in the American VHTR design, the fuel is a 3:1 ratio of UO2:UC2 for one essential reason, well explained by Olander [2] in a recent publication. During burnup, pure UO2 fuel tends to oxidize to UO2+x. UO2+x reacts with the pyrocarbon coating layer according to the equilibrium:(1)UO2+x + xC → UO2 + xCO

nan,"Designers of microfluidic devices are in need of computational tools that can be used to analyse problems that involve rarefied gas flows in complex micro geometries. Numerical simulation of the gas flow through such geometries is, however, extremely challenging. Conventional continuum fluid dynamics (CFD) becomes invalid or inaccurate as the characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the channel height, h) approaches the molecular mean free path, λ [1,2]. When λ/h≳0.1, the error in solutions obtained from CFD may be significant, and we must consider the fluid for what it is: a collection of interacting particles. However, the computational expense of simulating the flow of a rarefied gas in high-aspect-ratio micro geometries (i.e. ones that are long, relative to their cross section) using a particle method, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [2], can be prohibitively high [3,4]. The computational intensity of the particle method is greater still when simulating low-speed microfluidic devices where there are only small deviations from equilibrium, characterised by extremely low Mach numbers and weak temperature gradients.

As discussed in Section 3.2, two methods to extrapolate the value at the virtual upwind node, using data readily available on unstructured meshes, are considered. Given how the virtual upwind node is incorporated in the gradient ratio rf, the extrapolation method of Darwish and Moukalled [13] is referred to as implicit extrapolation and the method introduced by Ubbink and Issa [12] as explicit extrapolation. Both methods precisely reconstruct the upwind value for equidistant, rectilinear meshes but fail to do so on non-equidistant or non-rectilinear meshes, as discussed in Section 3.2. Using the explicit extrapolation method this issue can be rectified by imposing appropriate limits on the extrapolated upwind value.

nan,"Structural adhesives are increasingly used for bonding components within critical load bearing engineering structures such as aerospace and automotives. Typically these adhesives are based on epoxy polymers. Epoxies are inherently brittle due to their homogeneous microstructure and highly cross linked nature. Thus, there has been much research focused on improving the fracture toughness of epoxy polymers by incorporating a second minority phase at the nano-scale. These modifiers fall into one of two main categories: inorganic additives, e.g. silica [1,2], glass [3], alumina [4], nano-clays [5] and carbon nanotubes [6,7] or organic, usually rubber particles. Rubbery additives can be either core–shell rubber particles [8–10] or can form during curing via reaction induced phase separation mechanisms [11,12]. The primary energy dissipation mechanisms for rubber toughened epoxies are known to be both plastic void growth and shear band development [13]. It has also been shown that a combination of the above additives to create a hybrid material can provide synergistic toughening effects, e.g. carbon nanotubes and silica nanoparticles [14] or rubber with silica nanoparticles [15–17].

nan,"Methods for anomaly detection in a local context are the conceptual opposite to the afore-described centralized methods, which rely on globally shared models. In data mining, the notion of locality is often given as distance between data values (given a specific distance metric such as Euclidean distance). A data point is compared to the value of its nearest neighbors in terms of data distance [42]. However, the notion of locality can also be given in a geographical distance between the sources of the data. Many similar values (i.e., data with small distance among each other) result in a higher density, called clusters, while values that are less similar result in a lower density. Anomalies can fall outside of any cluster but, when frequently occurring, can form a cluster too. Determining if a datum is normal or anomalous compared to local neighborhood data is a challenge.

nan,"Powder metallurgy is a versatile technology for the manufacturing of components to (near) net-shape with high product quality. For a hardmetal (such as WC-Co) cold compaction of the powder to a “green body” is followed by liquid-phase sintering from the subsequent heating. This means that the binder metal Co is heated to melt in order to obtain sufficient mobility via capillary action, i.e., via surface traction, stemming from stored surface energy. The resulting flow causes gradual filling of the pore space and brings about a macroscopic shrinkage of the particle compact until a completely dense state is obtained, at least ideally. To model and quantitatively simulate the sintering process is a challenging task. The goal is to (i) estimate the final resulting quality (i.e., in terms of porosity) and (ii) to predict the final net shape and size of the sintered component.

nan,"These results demonstrate that SW-SVR predicts complicated micrometeorological data with the best prediction performance and the lowest computational complexity compared with standard algorithms. In particular, we found that dynamic aggregation of models built from very little extracted data by D-SDC is effective for compatibility of high prediction performance and low computational complexity. However, there are problems to be solved in SW-SVR. Firstly, the prediction performance of SW-SVR sometimes deteriorates despite an increase of training data. In particular, this problem occurred under the conditions that prediction horizons are 6 h as shown in Fig. 3. This is because data extracted by D-SDC involves unnecessary training data for highly accurate prediction. If D-SDC extracts the same data as the extracted data when training periods are shorter, the prediction performance of SW-SVR never deteriorates due to an increase of training data. Therefore, we must review both feature mapping and algorithms of D-SDC so as to avoid extracting unnecessary training data. Meanwhile, SW-SVR is based on a combination of several algorithms: kernel approximation, PLS regression, k-means, D-SDC, and linear SVR. Moreover, each algorithm has several parameters. Therefore, SW-SVR has more varied parameters, and it takes more time to tune the parameters. In this experiment, we used a grid search roughly so as to decide the parameters in a certain time. However, there is still room for improvement in the prediction performance by using other approaches such as a genetic algorithm instead of a grid search (Huang & Wang, 2006).

nan,"A multi-physics description of a multiscale system is often referred to as a ‘hybrid’ model. In fluid dynamics, a typical hybrid combines a molecular treatment (a ‘micro’ model) with a continuum-fluid one (a ‘macro’ model), with the aim of obtaining the accuracy of the former with the efficiency of the latter [1–4]. The micro and macro models generally have characteristic timescales that are very different, which means that time-accurate simulations can be extremely challenging: the size of the timestep required to make the micro model stable and accurate is so small that simulations over significant macro-scale time periods are intractable. If the system is ‘scale-separated’, a physical (as distinct from numerical) approximation can be made that enables the coupled models to advance at different rates (asynchronously) with negligible penalty on macro-scale accuracy. E et al. [5] were the first to introduce and implement this concept in a time-stepping method for coupled systems, referred to in the classification of Lockerby et al. [6] as a continuous asynchronous (CA) scheme (‘continuous’ since the micro and macro models advance without interruption [5]). In this paper we extend this idea to multiscale systems comprising an arbitrary number of coupled models.

nan,"In this paper, we present our experimental observations on how solvents can vary the TPA and TPF properties of fluorescent rhodamine (Rh) dyes Rh6G, RhB and Rh101. Rhodamines are well-known xanthenes dyes, which have been extensively used for many widespread applications in single-molecule detection [24], DNA-sequence determination [25], fluorescence labelling [26], etc. due to their strong fluorescence over the visible spectral region. Molecular geometries of rhodamine dyes are well-known [27,28] and indicate that all the structures are non-centrosymmetric. In general, for centrosymmetric molecules, TPA is forbidden when tuned to the transitions at one-half of the excitation frequencies. However, for non-centrosymmetric molecules due to symmetry relaxations, the single-photon absorption (SPA) peaks and TPA peaks may coincide. So we set our primary aim to find the effect of solvent polarity on the correlation of SPA and TPA peaks for all the dyes.

nan,"In addition, the prediction of solar cell’s temperature is very important for the electrical characterisation of CPV modules. Rodrigo et al. (2014) reviewed various methods for the calculation of the cell temperature in High Concentrator PV (HCPV) modules. The methods were categorised based on: (1) heat sink temperature, (2) electrical parameters and (3) atmospheric parameters. The first two categories are based on direct measurements of CPV modules in indoor or outdoor experimental setups and presented the highest degree of accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 1.7–2.5K). Most of the methods reviewed by Rodrigo et al. (2014) calculate the cell temperature at open-circuit conditions. Methods that predict the cell temperature at maximum power point (MPP) operation offer a more realistic approach since they include the electrical energy generation of the solar cells (i.e. real operating conditions); Yandt et al. (2012) described a method predicting the cell temperature at MPP based on electrical parameters and Fernández et al. (2014b) based on heat sink temperature with absolute RMSE 0.55–1.44K. Fernández et al. (2014a) also proposed an artificial neural network model to estimate the cell temperature based on atmospheric parameters and an open-circuit voltage model based on electrical parameters (Fernandez et al., 2013a) offering good accuracy (RMSE 3.2K and 2.5K respectively (Rodrigo et al., 2014)).

nan,"Using measured data from two arable sites in the UK we have shown that lags can have significant impact on model evaluation and can affect both the level of correlation between measured and simulated data and the magnitude of the sums of the residuals. Also, we used the division of MSE to three constituent statistics (SB, SDSD and LCS) to show how the level of correlation can affect the sum of residuals. By dividing the algorithm-predicted series of lag values into monthly sets and examining the frequency distribution of the lags, certain patterns in these temporally patchy series have been identified. A challenging task in relation to time lags between observed and simulated daily data, is to determine their cause. This task becomes more difficult for model outputs such as soil N2O emissions that are driven by various interacting variables. Even more so, because the measured N2O datasets and the measured datasets of their drivers (e.g. soil moisture, soil N content) cover small time periods, they are not continuous and can vary widely in size. In this study we implemented the algorithm using measured and simulated data for soil moisture (first and second example) and soil mineral N (second example), and compared its results with the respective results for N2O. In our first example, we showed that the estimated lags in N2O prediction are related to the lags in soil moisture prediction in a way that changes gradually through time. In our second example, the lags in N2O prediction were explained by the lags in soil moisture and soil mineral N prediction, with which they had a positive relationship.

nan,"It is well-known that the optical properties of atoms and molecules can be influenced by their electronic environment. Local field effects on spontaneous emission rates within nanostructured photonic materials for example are familiar, and have been well summarized [1]. Optical processes, including resonance energy transfer are similarly dependent on the local environment of molecular chromophores [2–4]. Many biological systems are known to contain complex organizations of molecules with absorption bands shifted due to the electronic influence of other, nearby optical centres. For instance, in widely studied light-harvesting complexes, there are two identifiable forms of the photosynthetic antenna molecule bacteriochlorophyll, with absorption bands centred on 800 and 850nm; it has been shown that the most efficient forms of energy transfer between the two occurs when there is a neighbouring carotenoid species 5–7. Until now, research on the broader influence of a neighbouring, off-resonant, molecule on photon absorption has mostly centred on the phenomenon of induced circular dichroism, where both quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations [8–10] and experimental procedures [11–13] predict and verify that a chiral mediator confers the capacity for an achiral acceptor to exhibit circular differential absorption.

nan,"As discussed above, proper inclusion of these interactions requires segment synchronization after every iteration. In order to minimize simulation errors due to incorrect values of the interactions potential, segments are synchronized after every iteration. Although relatively long communication times between remote processors may hinder this process in typical parallel computers, this is not the case for GPGPU architectures. Still, full recalculation of the interaction potential after each iteration is time consuming. Instead, the algorithm corrects the current potential by adding dipole contributions for every nearby charge that hopped during the previous iteration. Full updates of the interaction potential are only required for the grid points that are related to charges that hopped during the last iteration. Accumulative rounding errors that arise due to repetitive addition and subtraction are solve this by rounding all interaction potentials to a uniformly spaced range of floating point numbers.

nan,"In this work, light propagation in a scattering medium with piece-wise constant refractive index using the radiative transport equation was studied. Light propagation in each sub-domain with a constant refractive index was modeled using the RTE and the equations were coupled using boundary conditions describing Fresnel reflection and transmission phenomenas on the interfaces between the sub-domains. The resulting coupled system of RTEs was numerically solved using the FEM. The proposed model was tested using simulations and was compared with the solution of the Monte Carlo method. The results show that the coupled RTE model describes light propagation accurately in comparison with the Monte Carlo method. In addition, results show that neglecting internal refractive index changes can lead to erroneous boundary measurements of scattered light. This indicates that the quality of the DOT reconstructions could possible be increased by incorporating a model for internal refractive index changes in the image reconstruction procedure.

nan,"Mice bearing the orthotopic model were treated starting from day 21 after NB cell implant; mice with the pseudo-metastatic model received the first treatment 4h after NB cell injection. These therapeutic schedules were designed to test the effects of our targeted formulations against both established and pseudo-metastatic preclinical models of human NB, as described [16,19]. Animals were treated i.v. once a week for 3 weeks with untargeted (SL[DXR]) or peptide-targeted SL[DXR] (5mg/kg). Scrambled peptide-functionalized liposomes were used as a control, and in every experiment a group of control mice received HEPES-buffered saline. Survival times were used as the main criterion for determining treatment efficacy. In the orthotopic model, time-dependent anti-tumor activity was also evaluated by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and X-ray analyses. For this purpose, the GI-LI-N cell line was infected with a retrovirus expressing the firefly luciferase gene, as previously reported [17]; luciferase activity of retrovirally-transduced cells was visualized in vivo by BLI (IVIS Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) after a 10min incubation with 150μg/mL of d-luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences), as described [17].

nan,"In order for DLS based micro-rheology to be successful, there must be sufficient scattering contrast between the sample and the tracer particles. In order to achieve this, the maximum possible concentration of tracer particles was added such that single scattering events still dominated (as determined by measurements of diffusion coefficients in water at different concentrations). In order to determine whether or not the background scattering from the sample was sufficiently low compared to that of the tracer particles, we also compared the scattering intensities obtained from samples with and without tracer particles as a function of time. The results of this exercise are shown in Fig. 6. From this figure it can be seen that although initially the scattering from the sample without tracer particles is low compared to those containing tracer particles, as gelation proceeds this eventually ceases to be the case. This is presumably because of the development of supra-molecular structures, such as those seen previously (Fig. 2B). Based on the results in Fig. 6 it was decided to only use data collected in the first 240min of the experiment, after which point the scattering from the gel network became rather too large to ignore.

nan,"In summary, we have shown that one can describe the experimental data of the HERMES Collaboration for hadron attenuation on nuclei without invoking any changes in the fragmentation function due to gluon radiation. In our dynamical studies, that include the most relevant FSI, we employ only the ‘free’ fragmentation function on a nucleon and attribute the hadron attenuation to the deceleration of the produced (pre-)hadrons due to FSI in the surrounding medium. We find that in particular the z-dependence of RMh is very sensitive to the interaction cross section of leading prehadrons and can be used to determine σlead. The interaction of the leading prehadrons during the formation time could be interpreted as an in-medium change of the fragmentation function, which however could not be given in a closed form. The extracted average hadron formation times of τf≳0.3 fm/c are compatible with the analysis of antiproton attenuation in p+A reactions at AGS energies [17]. In an upcoming work we will investigate in detail the spectra for different particle species (π±,K±,p,p̄) to examine, if the formation times of mesons and antibaryons are about equal. In addition we will improve our model to describe the primary photon–nucleon reaction below the PYTHIA threshold of W⩾4 GeV.

nan,"In exploring the WKB limit of quantum theory, Bohm [2] was the first to notice that although one starts with all the ambiguities about the nature of a quantum system, the first order approximation fits the ordinary classical ontology. By that we mean that the real part of the Schrödinger equation under polar decomposition of the wave function becomes the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation in the limit where terms involving ℏ are neglected. In contrast to this approach, in this Letter we show that the classical trajectories arise from a short-time quantum propagator when terms of O(Δt2) can be neglected. This fact was actually already observed by Holland some twenty years ago: In page 269 of his book [6] infinitesimal time intervals are considered whose sequence constructs a finite path. It is shown that along each segment the motion is classical (negligible quantum potential), and that it follows that the quantum path may be decomposed into a sequence of segments along each of which the classical action is a minimum. The novel contribution of the present Letter is an improved proof of Hollandʼs result using an improved version of the propagator due to Makri and Miller [9,10].

nan,"With development of performance-based design, some studies have been conducted on fire risk analysis in buildings from different perspectives and levels. Models such as FiRECAM [11,12] and FiERAsystem [13] were used to calculate the expected life risk. In other studies probabilistic methods have been used to assess levels of people safety in buildings [14]. Quantitative risk analysis approaches have also been used to quantify the risk to occupants using stochastic factors [15]. However, studies to date have largely been concerned with various aspects of fire risk analysis and there has been little in the way of development of systematic theoretical methods for analyzing fire risk in buildings in terms of fire risk management. Existing fire risk management involves the identification of alternative fire safety design options [16,17], the ongoing inspection, maintenance of fire protection systems [18] and evacuation training and drills [19]. In this study, basic process of fire risk analysis in building is described, and a fire risk analysis model based on scenario clusters is established with consideration of the characteristics of fire dynamics and occupants' behavior. The number of deaths and directive property loss are selected as fire risk indices and the average fire risk of residential buildings is quantitatively analyzed, so that appropriate fire risk management measures can be adopted.

nan,"First-principles calculations have clarified the electronic structure and stability of the W@Si12 cluster under O2 molecule adsorption and reaction. Our results show that the W-encapsulated Si12 hexagonal prism cage is very inert to oxidation. The O2 molecule only weakly adsorbs onto the cluster at relatively low temperatures, in the range of several tens meV. However, significant reaction barriers (0.593–1.118 eV) for the O2 molecule on the cluster are identified on different adsorption sites, nevertheless, these reaction paths are spin forbidden reactions according to Wingerʼs spin selection rule. These results imply that O2 readily desorb from the cluster surface rather than dissociate and oxide the W@Si12 cluster upon excitations. In high temperature and high pressure conditions, the O2 molecules may dissociate on the preferential edge site by overcoming a significantly large energy barrier.

nan,"Hitherto, the investigation of fossil-orientation was only used for the topmost surface of fossil mass occurrences, deposited directly on the sea floor. Due to the fast development of virtual methods (e.g., macro-CT, µ-CT, nano-CT, etc.) it became possible, to investigate the interior orientation of such fossil mass occurrences in three-dimensional detail. Although, a series of paleontological studies deal with 3D-visualization of fossil-elements, no mass occurrence has previously been reconstructed three dimensionally for investigating their interior orientation. This study illustrates an interdisciplinary approach of virtual reconstruction, analyses and interpretation of the interior orientation of an ammonoid mass occurrence. The method established herein produces clear and consistent results using planispirally coiled ammonoid shells – fossils, that so far would have been used only with caution for depositional interpretations. This method can be applied to any kind of fossil mass occurrence, or even other abundant organic elements and particles, to examine their orientation and depositional conditions to conclude on their paleoenvironment, particularly on paleocurrents.

The PEDOT:PSS fluids also exhibited elasticity that steadily reduced with increasing frequency [4].

nan,"A central question from the point of view of nuclear physics involves the changes to the quark and antiquark distributions of a bound proton. Since one must develop a reliable model of both the free proton and the binding of nucleons starting from the quark level [8], this problem is rather complicated. We intend to report on our investigation of that problem in future work. For the present, we have chosen to illustrate the formal ideas developed here by applying them to a toy model, namely the quark distributions of isospin symmetric quark matter in which each quark feels a scalar potential, −Vsq, and a vector potential, Vvq. This is the premise of the Quark–Meson Coupling (QMC) model [9] which has been used successfully to calculate the properties of nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei [10,11]. Most recently it has also been used to derive an effective nuclear force which is very close to the widely used Skyrme III force [12]. (Except that in QMC the quarks are confined by the MIT bag, as well as feeling the mean-field scalar and vector potentials generated by the surrounding nucleons.) In the mean field approximation, the Dirac equation for the quark in infinite quark matter is written as: (30)iγ·∂−m−Vqs−γ0VqvψQMq(x)=0.

nan,"The related Volta potential (Ψ) is the potential difference between a position infinitely far away from the surface and a position just outside the surface, and is the measureable quantity characterising electrochemical behaviour of a metal [12,17]. The scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) technique allows detection of local EWF (if the EWF of the tip is known), or Volta potential differences (ΔΨ) between an atomic force microscopy tip (usually Pt coated) and the metal surface [14,15,19]. The lateral resolution of SKPFM can be as high as 10’s of nm in ambient air, with a sensitivity up to 10–20meV [19]. Volta potential is a characteristic property of a metal surface and can be used to understand electrochemical processes [16] . It is sensitive to any kind of surface defects, chemical variations, and residual stress [13,17]. Volta potential differences in microstructure have been used to predict corrosion behaviour [10,15,18,20–22]. Regions with larger (ΔΨ) indicate increased surface reactivity [11,15,18], and even a correlation between Volta potential differences measured in nominally dry air and their free corrosion potential (Ecorr) pre-determined under immersed conditions has been reported [18].

nan,"Zirconium alloys are used as cladding to encapsulate fuel pellets in pressurised and boiling water nuclear reactors. Research into oxidation of these alloys has been significant since the introduction of the material. However, the microstructure and electro-chemical processes during oxidation are complex and many questions still remain unanswered. One such issue is the formation of lateral cracks near the metal-oxide interface. Small cracks have been seen to form continuously during oxidation, with large scale networks of lateral cracks forming cyclically every ∼2μm of oxide growth. These networks of cracks can be correlated with acceleration in the corrosion kinetics [1–7]. These lateral cracks might enable the link up of nano pores along grain boundaries perpendicular to the metal/oxide interface as reported in [8,9]. Experiments using Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction (S-XRD) by both Polatidis et al. and Petigny et al., have separately shown that oxides formed on Zircaloy-4 are composed of monoclinic and stabilised tetragonal phases, with an ∼7% reduction in the tetragonal phase fraction from 1 to 3μm oxide growth [4,10]. One theory is that the lateral cracks may destabilise the tetragonal phase close to the metal-oxide interface. The phase transformation has an ∼6% expansion associated with it, which could lead to fracture perpendicular to the metal-oxide interface, thereby generating fast ingress routes for oxygen containing species [11,12].

nan,"Traditionally, the simulation of incompressible fluid flow by the SPH method has been through a weakly compressible SPH formulation (WCSPH). In this approach, the pressure is treated as a thermodynamic variable and is calculated using an artificial equation of state. The sound speed is set to be sufficiently high to limit density variations to within a small fraction of the actual fluid density. In practice, this high sound speed places a limitation on the maximum permissible time-step size through the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) constraint. A particular weakness relates to noise in the pressure field since a small perturbation in the local density will yield a large variation in the local pressure. This can make WCSPH formulations ineffective for accurate force and pressure prediction, although recent developments which create more uniform particle distributions have improved this [1,2]. A review of the SPH method can be found in [3] while a review of the classical WCSPH formulation applied to free-surface flows can be found in [4].

The ferromagnetic characteristics as coercivity, remanence and magnetic anisotropy of the nanocomposite can be adjusted by the electrochemical parameters. Furthermore the spatial distribution of the metal structures within the pores can be varied which means that the magnetic interactions between the particles can be influenced. In the case of densely packed particles within the pores dipolar coupling between them occurs and results in quasi magnetic chains which offer a much larger magnetic anisotropy than non-interacting particles. By modifying the current density small Ni-particles (3–6nm) can be deposited. If the packing density of these particles is sufficiently close, Ni-tubes of a few nanometer in thickness are covering the pore walls.

Indeed, structure and elasticity are important parameters for elucidating grain boundary stability. All potential models correctly predict the relative stability of the defect energies. The Morelon potential model performed best as it was specifically derived to replicate defect formation energies, but it largely underestimates the bulk modulus. The energies calculated with the Morl and the Arima potential models are overestimated; this is a known disadvantage of using rigid ion models as the ionic polarisability is not taken into account. For completeness, we report two shell models with the best results given by the Catlow potential model. The Morl, along with the Grimes shell potential model, accurately reproduce the activation energy of oxygen migration (the migration path was the lowest energy and most favourable diffusion mechanism observed in bulk UO2 [1]). The major deficiency of the Morl potential is that the cation defect energies are high, and hence the number of cation defects will be underestimated. However, this should not be an issue unless this model was applied to processes such as grain growth where cation mobility will contribute.

nan,"Our aim is to introduce vector mesons in terms of a Lagrangian which satisfies the low energy current algebra. One consistent method is in terms of a non-linear chiral Lagrangian with a hidden local symmetry [6]. In this theory the vector mesons emerge as dynamical vector mesons. The three point vector-pseudo scalar interaction is given by (11)ih4〈Vμ(P∂μP−∂μPP)〉, where h stands for the vector-pseudoscalar coupling. Some typical vertices of ρ's to pseudoscalar mesons are (12)π+(p1)π−(p2)ρ0:h(p1−p2)μεμ,π+(p1)π0(p2)ρ−:h(p1−p2)μεμ,K+(p1)K¯0(p2)ρ−:h2(p1−p2)μεμ,etc., which is directly related to the ρ decay width: Γ(ρ)=h2(|pπ|)3/(6πmρ2), where pπ is the momentum of final state pions in the ρ rest frame. With Γ(ρ)=149.2MeV, we find h=5.95. We note in passing that the Kawarabayashi–Suzuki–Riazuddin–Fayyazuddin relation gives the value h=mρ/(2fπ)[12]. Thus the value of h in Eq. (4) and the two values in this paragraph differ by small amounts (∼19%). The strong four-point vertices involving pions are obtained from the first two terms of Eq. (5). The weak vertices are obtained from the definitions of Q6 and Q8. In the numerical work we shall use the value of h from Eq. (4) and also h=5.95 obtained from the decay width.

nan,"In the bag model and in linear or harmonic oscillator confining potentials, the first excited S-state lies above the lowest P-state, making the predicted Roper mass heavier than the lightest negative parity baryon mass. Pairwise spin-dependent interactions must reverse the level ordering. As mentioned earlier, color-spin interactions fail in this regard [29], while flavor-spin interactions produce the desired effect. Since the q3 color wave function is antisymmetric, the flavor-spin-orbital wave function is totally symmetric. For all quarks in an S-state, the flavor-spin wave function is totally symmetric all by itself and leads to the most attractive flavor-spin interaction. If one quark is in a P-state, the orbital wave function is mixed symmetry and so is the flavor-spin wave function, and the flavor-spin interaction is a less attractive. In the SU(3)F symmetric case, Eq. (1), one obtains mass splittings (2)ΔMχ=−14Cχ,N(939),N∗(1440),−4Cχ,Δ(1232),−2Cχ,N∗(1535).

nan,"The above discussion also lays bare the difference of perspectives between the fusion of hard constraints and knowledge-base merging: the idea of Konieczny and Pino-Perez is to explain the fusion of plain epistemic states, understood as a set of plausible worlds, by the existence of underlying partial orderings or numerical plausibility degrees (obtained by distances), based on axioms that only use plausible sets attached to these orderings. In [67] the same authors use both hard (integrity) constraints and belief sets referring to plausible worlds, and try to extend both the AGM revision and knowledge-based merging. However, they do not envisage the merging of integrity constraints discussed in the previous section. The belief revision and merging literature takes an external point of view on cognitive processes under study. The underlying ordered structures are here a consequence of the merging postulates, but they do not appear explicitly in the axioms and they are not observable from the outside. On the contrary, our approach is to construct fusion rules that only rely on what is explicitly supplied by sources. In the sequel we consider the counterpart of our fusion postulates for ranked models, that can be expressed by means of total orders of possible worlds or by their encodings on a plausibility scale.

nan,"The expression for Pc is also easily found in the same basis, where it becomes apparent that the dynamics of conversion in matter depends only on the relative orientation of the eigenstates of the vacuum and matter Hamiltonians. This allows to directly apply the known analytical solutions for Pc, and, upon rotating back, obtain a generalization of these results to the NSI case. For example, the answer for the infinite exponential profile [18,19] A∝exp(−r/r0) becomes Pc=exp[γ(1−cos2θrel)/2]−1exp(γ)−1, where γ≡4πr0Δ=πr0Δm2/Eν. We further observe that since γ⪢1 the adiabaticity violation occurs only when |θ−α|⪡1 and φ≃π/2, which is the analogue of the small-angle MSW [10,20] effect in the rotated basis. The “resonant” region in the Sun where level jumping can take place is narrow, defined by A≃Δ [21]. A neutrino produced at a lower density evolves adiabatically, while a neutrino produced at a higher density may undergo level crossing. The probability Pc in the latter case is given to a very good accuracy by the formula for the linear profile, with an appropriate gradient taken along the neutrino trajectory, (12)Pc≃Θ(A−Δ)e−γ(cos2θrel+1)/2, where Θ(x) is the step function, Θ(x)=1 for x>0 and Θ(x)=0 otherwise. We emphasize that our results differ from the similar ones given in [5,22] in three important respects: (i) they are valid for all, not just small values of α (which is essential for our application), (ii) they include the angle φ, and (iii) the argument of the Θ function does not contain cos2θ, as follows from [21]. We stress that for large values of α and φ≃π/2 adiabaticity is violated for large values of θ.

The spectral/hp continuous Galerkin method considered closely resembles the formulation presented in [7]. Sec. 2.1 describes in detail the derivation of the semi-discrete advection–diffusion problem as applied to wave-like solutions, from which the relevant eigencurves can be obtained. The inviscid case (linear advection) is then addressed in Sec. 2.2, where the role of primary and secondary eigencurves is discussed from the perspective introduced in [9].

nan,"This work shows how our approach based on the combination of Statistical Mechanics and nonlinear PDEs theory provides us with a novel and powerful tool to tackle phase transitions. This method leads to solution of perhaps the most known test-case that exhibits a first order phase transition (semi-heuristically described) such as the van der Waals model. In particular we have obtained the first global mean field partition function (Eq. (9)), for a system of finite number of particles. The partition function is a solution to the Klein–Gordon equation, reproduces the van der Waals isotherms away from the critical region and, in the thermodynamic limit N→∞ automatically encodes the Maxwell equal areas rule.

This is called the “Garden Sprinkler Effect” and has been extensively studied in [48,49,20]. (In the Boltzmann transport community this is known as the ray effect.) To showcase this effect in the angular dimension, a large spatial domain (4000km×4000km) is simulated, with a monochromatic wave propagating over a long distance in deep water (d=10000m). For the spatial discretisation a structured triangle mesh is used, with an element edge length of 67km (Fig. 11(a)). The initial wave field, located 500km from the lower and left side has a Gaussian distribution in space, with a significant wave height of Hs=2.5m and a standard deviation of 150km (Fig. 11(b)).

nan,"Topological insulators (TIs) are promising candidates of spintronics materials because of their robust helical surface states and the extremely strong spin–orbit interaction [1–3]. Initially, binary chalcogenides Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 have been identified as three-dimensional TIs by surface sensitive probes such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Later, ternary chalcogenide (BixSb1−x)2Te3 [4,5], which has similar tetradymite structure to the parent compounds Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3, was predicted by ab initio calculations and confirmed by ARPES measurements as a tunable topological insulator whose Fermi energy and carrier density can be adjusted via changing the Bi/Sb composition ratio with stable topological surface state for the entire composition range. Combined with magnetism or superconductivity, TIs have attracted great attention due to the rich variety of new physics and applications. The ferromagnetism in several transition metal (TM) doped TIs, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry, has been reported [6–13]. Ferromagnetism in TIs is important because the combination of magnetism with TIs makes a good platform to study fundamental physical phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect [14–17], Majorana fermions [18], image magnetic monopole effect [19], and topological contributions to the Faraday and Kerr magneto-optical effect [20].

nan,"A popular choice is to couple a set of quadrature points with an equal number of nodal Lagrange polynomials defined at the same points, leading to a collocation method. There are many examples of this throughout the literature, both in terms of the more traditionally utilised continuous Galerkin (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulations, as well as newer extensions such as the flux reconstruction (FR) technique as presented by Huynh [23]. In collocation methods, while most linear operators can be exactly integrated in this setting depending on the choice of quadrature, integrals of nonlinear terms typically incur numerical error. However, the computational efficiencies that can be attained through the use of a collocation formulation, especially given the presence of a diagonal mass matrix, often outweigh the numerical error that is incurred.

Layers deposited by this technique have been used in electromagnetic wave shielding, in the metallization process of through-holes in printed wiring boards, and in the manufacture of conducting polymers (such as Teflon) [37,38,39]. An advantage of this dip-coating process is that it can be used for any kind of surface, provided the substrate is stable in water and that the particles used for the coating form a meta-stable dispersion. Recently, a non-aqueous SIC coating process of carbon black was developed by investigating the stabilities of non-aqueous dispersions [36].

nan,"In this section, we use the terrain data processing as an example to describe the geodetic data transformation method. Since Google Maps/Earth server only gives the terrain data in graphical display, we have to get terrain digital data from other sources. The fine-resolution (3″ or finer) terrain data bases such as SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographical Mission) or USGS's DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data are necessary. Moreover, since 3DWF is used to model the fine-scale (meters up to 100m) atmospheric flow, it needs fine resolution terrain data. In this project, we use the terrain elevation data set from SRTM (Farr et al. 2007) with 3-arcsecond (~90m resolution at the equator) resolution. The data covers the land area, nearly global from 56S to 60N latitudes. We use the processed version 4 SRTM data set as described in Gamache (2005) in which some of the missing data holes were filled. The original data is organized in WGS84 (World Geodetic System 84) geodetic coordinate system. When the data are applied to the 3DWF model, they are transformed to the local East, North and Up (ENU) coordinate (see Fig. 3). Since the 3DWF is a fine scale wind model and its entire model domain is not intended to be larger than 20×20km, this Cartesian coordinate system is a good choice with very little distortion due to the curvature of the Earth's surface. The transformation from the WGS84 data to the ENU coordinate is performed as follows (Fukushima, 2006; Featherstone and Claessens, 2008).

nan,"In general, liquid film flows of practical relevance are turbulent and, hence, are associated with the presence of broadband interfacial waves on the film surface. A thorough understanding of the characteristic profiles, scales and dynamics of these interfacial waves is of essential importance in making accurate and reliable predictions of heat and mass transfer rates (Mathie and Markides, 2013a; Mathie et al., 2013). Previous efforts in downwards annular flow have focused on the spatio/temporal measurement of liquid film thickness, followed by in-depth statistical analyses of this film thickness (Webb and Hewitt, 1975; Belt et al., 2010; Alekseenko et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013). These efforts have contributed to a much improved understanding of the interfacial topology observed in downwards annular flows and also to the subsequent proposal of a series of correlations for the quantification of the mean film thickness, wave amplitudes and liquid entrainment rates into the gas phase (Ambrosini et al., 1991; Karapantsios and Karabelas, 1995; Azzopardi, 1997). On the other hand, less has been published on the velocity distribution and the flow structure within the liquid films, underneath the film surface. This can be related to the relative difficulty of these measurements caused by: (i) the extremely restricted measurement space, due to the small thickness of the liquid films (in the order of and often sub-mm), (ii) the highly disturbed and intermittent nature of the gas–liquid interface, (iii) the entrainment of gas inside the liquid film and of liquid into the gas core, and (iv) the relatively high velocities of both the gas and liquid phases.

nan,"Robust and automatic thresholding of gray level images has been commonly used in the field of pattern recognition and computer vision for objects detecting, tracking and recognizing. The Otsu scheme, a widely used image thresholding technique, provides approving results for segmenting a gray level image with only one modal distribution in gray level histogram. However, it provides poor results if the histogram of a gray level is non-bimodal. For enhancing the performance of the Otsu algorithm further, in this work, an improved median-based Otsu image thresholding algorithm is presented.

nan,"As mentioned earlier, this paper represents ongoing efforts to efficiently address the stochastic MPSP. Future work may consider investigating whether the algorithm would be as successful or not in solving variants of the MPSP that include more operational constraints, such as variable cut-off grade, grade blending, and stockpiling, as it is in solving the “classical” variant considered in this paper. Indeed, it is a general-purpose algorithm and should be applicable to any of these variants. Other research avenues include considering other strategies for updating the penalties within PH and other methods for solving the sub-problems. Finally, another important research direction is the development of other efficient solution approaches. Since it has been observed empirically that the problem formulation often achieves small integrality gaps, one approach could be to solve the linear relaxation of the problem using an efficient algorithm and then to use an LP-rounding procedure to get an integer solution.

nan,"Table 1 lists 8 pairs of B decays. In fact, there are more decay pairs, since many of the particles in the final states can be observed as either pseudoscalar (P) or vector (V) mesons. Note that certain decays are written in terms of VV final states, while others are have PP states. There are three reasons for this. First, some decays involve a final-state π0. However, experimentally it will be necessary to find the decay vertices of the final particles. This is virtually impossible for a π0, and so we always use a ρ0. Second, some pairs of decays are related by SU(3) in the SM only if an (ss¯) quark pair is used. However, there are no P's which are pure (ss¯). The mesons η and η′ have an (ss¯) component, but they also have significant (uu¯) and (dd¯) pieces. As a result the b¯→s¯ and b¯→d¯ decays are not really related by SU(3) in the SM if the final state involves an η or η′. We therefore consider instead the vector meson ϕ which is essentially a pure (ss¯) quark state. Finally, we require that both B0 and B¯0 be able to decay to the final state. This cannot happen if the final state contains a single K0 (or K¯0) meson. However, it can occur if this final-state particle is an excited neutral kaon. In this case one decay involves K*0, while the other has K¯*0. Assuming that the vector meson is detected via its decay to ψKsπ0 (as in the measurement of sin2β via Bd0(t)→J/ψK*), then both B0 and B¯0 can decay to the same final state.

nan,"Spark plasma sintering (SPS) is a relatively new sintering-based technique [17] in which the powder to be consolidated is loaded into an electrically and thermally conductive graphite mould and a large DC pulsed current (1000–5000A) is applied under a uniaxial pressure. When current passes through the graphite mould (and the powder if it is electrically conductive), the powder is heated both from the outside (the mould acts as a heating element) and inside (due to Joule heating from the intrinsic electrical resistance of the powder material). SPS is characterised by very fast heating (up to 2000°C/min) and cooling rates and short holding times (minutes) to achieve near theoretical density [17]. Thus SPS occupies a very different time–temperature–density space in powder consolidation maps when compared with conventional methods, such as hot pressing sintering and HIP with ramp rate of 50–80°C/min and a few hours holding time. Although SPS has been studied for a rapidly growing number of materials [17], there are only a small number of studies on the fabrication and microstructural characterisation of ODS steels processed by SPS, briefly reviewed below.

In the conventional method to assay pollen tube growth, the pollen tubes grow in a disorderly manner on solid medium, rendering it impossible to observe their growth in detail. Here, we present a new method to assay pollen tube growth using poly-dimethylsiloxane microchannel device to isolate individual pollen tubes. The growth of the pollen tube is confined to the microchannel and to the same focal plane, allowing accurate microscopic observations. This methodology has the potential for analyses of pollen tube growth in microfluidic environments in response to chemical products and signaling molecules, which paves the way for various experiments on plant reproduction.

nan,"The Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) is a well-developed perturbation theory used to describe quantitatively the volumetric properties of fluids. The reader is referred to several reviews on the topic which describe the various stages of its development and the multiple versions available [50–53]. The fundamental difference between the versions is in the underlying intermolecular potential employed to describe the unbounded constituent particles. Hard spheres, square well fluids, LJ fluids, argon, alkanes have all been employed as reference fluids in the different incarnations of SAFT. For the purpose of this work we will center on a particular version of the SAFT EoS, i.e. the SAFT-VR Mie recently proposed by Laffitte et al. [54] and expanded into a group contribution approach, SAFT-γ, by Papaioannou et al. [55]. This particular version of SAFT provides a closed form EoS that describes the macroscopical properties of the Mie potential [56], also known as the (m,n) potential; a generalized form of the LJ potential (albeit predating it by decades). The Mie potential has the form(1)ϕ(r)=Cεσrλr−σrλawhere C is an analytical function of the repulsive and attractive exponents, λa and λr, respectively, σ is a parameter that defines the length scale and is loosely related to the average diameter of a Mie bead; ɛ defines the energy scale and corresponds to the minimum potential energy between two isolated beads; expressed here as a ratio to the Boltzmann constant, kB. The Mie function, as written above, deceivingly suggests that four parameters are needed to characterize the behaviour of an isotropic molecule, however the exponents λa and λr are intimately related, and for fluid phase equilibria, one needs not consider them as independent parameters [57]. Accordingly, we choose herein to fix the attractive exponent to λa=6 which would be expected to be representative of the dispersion scaling of most simple fluids and refer from here on to the repulsive parameter as λ=λr. The potential simplifies to(2)ϕ(r)=λλ−6λ66/(λ−6)εσrλ−σr6

nan,"For all volunteers the AAMM technique significantly (p < 0.01) outperformed the other two methods in all of the intervals as can be seen by comparing to the error curves shown in Fig. 8 and the figures in Table 1 in the supplementary materials. Significance was assessed using a 1-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test since the error distributions were generally not symmetric. The estimation errors for AAMM and its non-adaptive counterpart, AAMM (no adapt.), were similar in the beginning of the application phase, but as anticipated, as the application phase went on, the AAMM technique continually improved its accuracy by incorporating more and more data into the model. On average the motion estimation of AAMM improved by 22.94% in T5 with respect to its non-adaptive counterpart. However, the method has already significantly adapted to the breathing pattern in T2, i.e. after between 3 and 7 min of imaging, where motion estimations where on average 16.87% more accurate than at the beginning of the adaptation phase. By visually inspecting the curves for AAMM in Fig. 8 it can be seen that for many volunteers (in particular volunteers A, D, E, and F) the error curves start to flatten approximately around the 7 min mark. From this it can be concluded that a longer calibration scan of around 12 min would be optimal, that is the 5 min that were used for calibration in this experiment plus 7 min worth of data added during the application phase. Note that this time could be significantly reduced if a non-cardiac-gated sequence was used.

The asymmetrically heated measurement set-up (Fig. 2a) allows to change the contacted electrode within seconds and thereby to gain statistical information over a large number of different microelectrodes on one and the same sample in a relatively short time. It also enables monitoring of optical changes during the measurement in real time. However, the asymmetrical heating from the bottom side and local cooling (e.g. by convection, radiation, and the contacting tip acting as a heat sink) is known to cause temperature gradients within the sample [11]. Such temperature gradients are responsible for thermo-voltages, which can lead to measurement artifacts in electrochemical experiments [24]. Moreover, in this set-up temperature cycles can hardly be performed on single microelectrodes but require subsequent contacting and de-contacting of different microelectrodes.

nan,"It is known that as the temperature of the sample rises, the Lorentz mechanism remains dominant until Tc of steel is reached (770°C for a low carbon steel), when the magnetostrictive mechanism becomes more efficient [15]. Previously this has been thought due to a thin ferromagnetic oxide layer on the sample surface, the surface being cooler than the bulk of the material [16,17]. This layer concentrates the magnetic field, increasing generation efficiency. Recent studies also show that rearrangement of the magnetic moments from ordered domains to a disordered state at a magnetic phase transition lowers the magnetostrictive constant. This ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition is accompanied by large changes in the efficiency of electromagnetic ultrasound generation leading to the use of EMATs as a method of studying phase transitions in magnetic alloys [18].

nan,"Since the receptors in human biology mostly consist of chiral molecules, drug action mostly involves a specified enantiomeric form. This has spurred the development, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, of a host of techniques to secure enantiopure products. Such methods, mostly multi-step and time-consuming, can typically be cast in one of two distinct categories: synthetic mechanisms designed to produce a single stereoisomer, or separation techniques to isolate distinct enantiomers from a racemic mixture. A significant drawback, for either approach, is a dependence on a supply of enantiopure reagents or substrates – synthesis routes generally utilise chiral building blocks or enantioselective catalysts [7,8], while enantiomer separation techniques typically incorporate chiral selector molecules to form chemically distinct and distinguishable diastereomeric complexes [8,9]. A key requirement in aiming to achieve enantiopure products, irrespective of the synthetic method, is therefore a means to measure, and duly quantitate the enantiomeric excess – signifying the degree of chirality within molecular products. Chiral discrimination through optical means is well-known to offer direct, non-contact ways to distinguish between molecules of different handedness, based on observations such as the subtle differences in absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarised light, or indeed the twisting of polarisation in optical rotation. Other optical methods, under more recent development, also show some promise to achieve enantiomer separation, as will be introduced later.

The physical properties of the slave surface are interpolated to a ghost mesh (termed phony elements in [17]) that overlays the slave zones. The physical properties are interpolated from the slave surface to the ghost zones using surface area weights. The surface area weights are equal to the ratio of the ghost zone surface area to the surface area of the master surface. The contact surface method for nodal-based Lagrangian cell-centered hydrodynamics (CCH) presented in this paper will use surface area weights similar in concept to those in TOODY. Following the area fraction approach of TOODY may seem retrospective; however, using surface area weights naturally extends to the new CCH methods that solve a Riemann-like problem at the node of a zone [10,24,25,3].

nan,"The exquisite manipulation and exact measurement of properties of individual nanomaterials, compared with notable progress in their preparation, have not been thoroughly addressed albeit being of prime importance for the sustained development of new devices [58–61]. To date, several instruments have been designed for such goals, namely, scanning electron microscopes (SEM), atomic force microscopes (AFM) and transmission electron microscopes (TEM) [62,63]. Compared with the first two setups, which have no direct access to the material internal structure and atomic bonding information [64–67], the state-of-the-art in situ high-resolution TEM technique allows one to not only manipulate with an individual object at the nano-scale precision but to also get deep insights into its physical, chemical, and microstructural statuses [68–71]. Combining the capabilities of a conventional high-resolution TEM and AFM or STM probes produces advanced and dedicated TEM holders, which are becoming the powerful tools in nanomaterials manipulation and properties analysis. Such holders have been commercialized, for instance, by “Nanofactory Instruments AB’’, Goteborg, Sweden [72]. The full usefulness of these advanced in-situ TEM techniques is apparent with respect to mechanical and thermal property analysis of individual nanostructures, e.g., elasticity, plasticity and strength data while employing direct bent or tensile tests [73–75], probing electrical characteristics, e.g., field emission [27,76,77], electrical transport tracing [78–80], soldering [81,82], and doping [83], etc.

nan,"A fluctuating vacuum is a general feature of quantum fields, of which the free Maxwell field considered in  [1–12] is but one example. Fermionic fields such as that describing the electron, also undergo vacuum fluctuations, consequently one expects to find Casimir effects associated with such fields whenever they are confined in some way. Such effects were first investigated in the context of nuclear physics, within the so-called “MIT bag model” of the nucleon  [13]. In the bag-model one envisages the nucleon as a collection of fermionic fields describing confined quarks. These quarks are subject to a boundary condition at the surface of the ‘bag’ that represents the nucleon’s surface. Just as in the electromagnetic case, the bag boundary condition modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field, which results in the appearance of a Casimir force  [14–18]. This force, although very weak at a macroscopic scale, can be significant on the small length scales encountered in nuclear physics. It therefore has important consequences for the physics of the bag-model nucleon  [19].

nan,"Typical physically-based 2D flood models solve the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs), requiring high computational resources. Many of these models have been developed to obtain better performance, while maintaining the required accuracy, by reducing the complexity of the SWEs. This reduction is usually achieved by approximating or neglecting less significant terms of the equations (Hunter et al., 2007; Yen and Tsai, 2001). The JFLOW model (Bradbrook et al., 2004), Urban Inundation Model (UIM) (Chen et al., 2007), and the diffusive version of LISFLOOD-FP (Hunter et al., 2005) solve the 2D diffusion wave equations that neglect the inertial (local acceleration) and advection (convective acceleration) terms (Yen and Tsai, 2001). The inertial version of LISFLOOD-FP (Bates et al., 2010) solves the SWEs without the advection term. In either version of LISFLOOD-FP the flow is decoupled in the Cartesian directions. Other models use the full SWEs but focus on the use of multi resolution grids or irregular mesh, like InfoWorks ICM (Innovyze, 2012) and MIKE FLOOD (DHI Software, 2014; Hénonin et al., 2013). These last two models are commercial packages, and the code applied in the optimisation techniques is not in the public domain.

nan,"Although mean-field models have been used in all these settings, little analysis has been done on their behaviour as spatially extended dynamical systems. In part, this is due to their staggering complexity. The Liley model [15] considered here, for instance, consists of fourteen coupled Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with strong nonlinearities, imposed by coupling between the mean membrane potentials and the mean synaptic inputs. The model can be reduced to a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) by considering only spatially homogeneous solutions, and the resulting system has been examined in detail using numerical bifurcation analysis (see [16] and references therein). In order to compute equilibria, periodic orbits and such objects for the PDE model, we need a flexible, stable simulation code for the model and its linearization that can run in parallel to scale up to a domain size of about 2500cm2, the size of a full-grown human cortex. We also need efficient, iterative solvers for linear problems with large, sparse matrices. In this paper, we will show that all this can be accomplished in the open-source software package PETSc [17]. Our implementation consists of a number of functions in C that are available publicly [18].

nan,"Denier and Hewitt [12] have shown that bounded solutions to 9a, 9b and 9c subject to (10a) and (10b) exist only in the shear-thinning case for n>12. In the shear-thickening case they have shown that solutions become non-differentiable at some critical location ηc, and although it transpires that this singularity can be regularised entirely within the context of the power-law model, we will not consider such flows here. Thus in this study we will consider flows with power-law index in the range 12<n⩽1. They have also shown that for 12<n<1 to ensure the correct algebraic decay in the numerical solutions one must apply the Robin condition(11)(u¯′,v¯′)=nη(n-1)(u¯,v¯)asη→∞,at some suitably large value of η=η∞≫1. In the Newtonian case this relationship becomes singular, this is due to the fact that when n=1 the functions u¯ and v¯ decay exponentially. Cochran [13] showed that in this case(12)(u¯′,v¯′)=w¯∞(u¯,v¯)asη→∞,where w∞=-2∫0∞u¯dη.

nan,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been widely used in science and engineering problems. They attempt to model the ability of biological nervous systems to recognize patterns and objects. ANN basic architecture consists of networks of primitive functions capable of receiving multiple weighted inputs that are evaluated in terms of their success at discriminating the classes in Τa. Different types of primitive functions and network configurations result in varying models (Hastie et al., 2009; Rojas, 1996). During training network connection weights are adjusted if the separation of inputs and predefined classes incurs an error. Convergence proceeds until the reduction in error between iterations reaches a decay threshold (Kotsiantis, 2007; Rojas, 1996).

The third experimental system is a fibrin gel formed by the thrombin-induced polymerisation of fibrinogen molecules. The gel network product in the latter case forms the principal microstructural component of a blood clot [8].

nan,"The threshold values for removing large caters were determined by examining the craters within the study area, referencing previous studies (Molloy and Stepinski, 2007), and some trial and error. After the parameter values are determined, the rest of the process is automated. However, we do anticipate some minimum manual editing may be needed in some complicated terrains when apply it to all of Mars. To minimize the distortion resulted from map projection on global datasets, we will choose an equal area projection by evaluating the options suggested in Steinwand et al. (1995) or conduct geodesic area calculation using software such as “Tools for Graphics and Shapes” (http://www.jennessent.com/arcgis/shapes_graphics.htm)Although post-formational modification to the valleys may be minimum (Williams and Phillips, 2001), there may nonetheless be modifications such as eolian fill and mass wasting (e.g., Grant et al., 2008). Thus the volume estimates derived with PBTH method represents a lower bound. Comparing the estimates from MOLA and HRSC data reveals that MOLA estimate is about 91% of HRSC value. However, MOLA has global coverage whereas HRSC does not. Therefore, for areas where there is only MOLA coverage, the estimate may be scaled upward by 1.1 times. The algorithm has been tested on DEMs with various resolutions (2 m for simulated DEM, 75m for HRSC, and 463m for MOLA). It can certainly be applied to higher resolution DEMs for Mars when they become available, but the threshold values will need to be adjusted.

Existing modeling approaches are not capable of expressing the unpredictable, non-routine nature of human collaboration, which is influenced by the social context of involved collaborators. We propose a modeling approach which considers collaboration processes as the evolution of a network of collaborative documents along with a social network of collaborators. Our modeling approach, accompanied by a graphical notation and formalization, allows to capture the influence of complex social structures formed by collaborators, and therefore facilitates such activities as the discovery of socially coherent teams, social hubs, or unbiased experts. We demonstrate the applicability and expressiveness of our approach and notation, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

It has long been known that cardiovascular signals contain a number of oscillatory components that are not exactly periodic. To put it differently, their periods (frequencies) fluctuate with time. For example, heart rate variability (HRV) has in itself provided a major topic of discussion. We introduce one of the statistical approaches to HRV in Section 3. However, in order to understand the variability of the cardiovascular system, discussion of a single source is insufficient because the cardiovascular system is composed of many different physiological components (subsystems) and it is the effects of their mutual interaction that combine to produce HRV. This is demonstrated in Section 4, revealed by results obtained using the wavelet transform. In Section 5, we discuss the cardio-respiratory interaction in terms of phase synchronization. To set the scene for these later discussions, we summarize the basic principles of phase dynamics in Section 2. For readers who are unfamiliar with the physiological aspects of the research, we provide Appendices A on the cardiovascular system and B on how measurements of cardiovascular signals are conducted.

The size of the asymmetry is proportional to the primary production asymmetry between squarks and anti-squarks. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for a particular mSUGRA model point at the LHC.

The finite element method, while providing the most rigorous and exhaustive representation of the pile group-related problem, is generally computationally expensive and considered mainly a research tool rather than a design tool. Conversely, the versatility of simplified (approximate) methods, such as the interaction factor approach that allows capturing the (e.g., vertical) displacements of any general pile group by the analysis of the displacement interaction between two identical piles and by the use of the elastic principle of superposition of effects, makes them attractive as design tools because they allow for the use of expedient parametric studies under various design conditions.

Such tests include studies of the nitrogen exchange reaction [14] both adiabatic by running trajectories on the lowest surfaces and non-adiabatic by using the trajectory surface hoping (TSH) method [22,23] for transitions to the excited state of same symmetry. It was concluded that nonadiabatic transitions could not make a significant impact on the rate coefficients, and therefore all trajectories here reported are independently integrated for each symmetry on the corresponding lowest adiabatic PES. In fact, we have tested the impact of running the trajectories starting on the upper sheets, and found no vibrational transition to take place, only small amounts of rotational energy is exchanged in this case. Also neglected are electronic transitions to the quartet state which are believed to be far less probable than the simple vibrational energy transfer here studied due to their spin-forbidden character. It should also be noted that the use of quasiclassical trajectories is justified by the large masses of the atoms involved [24].

nan,"Water is the most important liquid, and the nature of its structure remains a topic of keen debate and an active area of research [1–9]. Much of this debate centers around whether water has a mainly tetrahedral structure with a continuum of distorted hydrogen bonds, or if it contains a mixture of two distinct components. One major development in recent years is the application of inner-shell spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at the oxygen K-edge to investigate the structure of water [2,10–12]. These methods can provide a direct structural probe of water, providing insight into the nature of its hydrogen bonding network. Theoretical studies play a critical role in these studies, since the analysis of the experimental data requires calculations to provide a link between the observed spectral features and the underlying structure. However, the simulation of the XAS or XES for liquid water presents a difficult challenge because it requires accurate molecular dynamics simulations to provide a correct description of the molecular structure coupled with accurate calculations of the spectral properties, i.e. excitation energies and line intensities. Furthermore, adequate sampling over molecular configurations also needs to be accounted for.

nan,"Brodsky and Lepage [8] have proposed a formula for meson pair production which looks similar to (25), except for a different charge factor and the appearance of the timelike electromagnetic meson form factor instead of the annihilation form factor R(s). This formula was obtained from the leading-twist result by neglecting part of the amplitudes with opposite photon helicities. As has been pointed out in [9], this part is however not approximately independent of the pion distribution amplitude and not generically small. We also remark that the appearance of Fπ(s) in the γγ→π+π− amplitude is no longer observed if corrections from partonic transverse momentum in the hard scattering process are taken into account, and that these corrections are not numerically small for the values of s we are dealing with [13]. Notice further that two-photon annihilation produces two pions in a C-even state, whereas the electromagnetic form factor projects on the C-odd state of a pion pair. In contrast, our annihilation form factor R2π(s) is C-even as discussed after (24). Finally, due to a particular charge factor, the Brodsky–Lepage formula leads to a vanishing cross section for γγ annihilation into pairs of neutral pseudoscalars.

For γ-ray radiation, single step is the main process to cause DSBs (see Figure 3b), which is attributed to the generation of number of ROS upon the incident of individual photon of γ-ray. Whereas photo-radiation causes DSBs through two step mechanism (Figure 3a) by reflecting that each single photon causes mostly single ROS and thus induces only single strand break. Then, when a second single strand break occurs where near the existing single strand break, DBS is caused, i.e., the two step mechanism. Summarizing the results and discussion we may conclude as that: (1) The significant protective effect of AA against photo-induced damage may reflect the effective diminish of ROS by AA. (2) For the γ-ray induced DSB, the protective effect by AA is a little bit weaker than the case of photo irradiation. This may be due to the generation of numbers of ROS by single photon of γ-ray. Surviving oxygen species against the diminishment effect by AA may cause DSBs. (3) As for the DSBs by ultrasound, damage is caused by the shockwave through the generation of cavitations [18]. Thus, the chemical effect of AA to diminish ROS is considered to be negligibly small for the protection of DSBs.

nan,"Inequality (22) indicates that the maximum-norm is the loosest among all p-norms. Fortunately, this loosest constraint would not seriously affect the accuracy since the value of ||y||∞ is comparable to that of the 2-norm and 1-norm. The maximum-norm provides us with the largest number of possible solutions under a given error limitation [24]. This would greatly enhance the possibility of finding a group of optimized coefficients when scanning a vast solution set. On the other hand, checking the maximum deviation sounds more reasonable than checking the “distance” between the accurate and approximated wave numbers since it is not working in the space domain. Therefore, we chose the maximum-norm as our criterion for designing the objective functions to extend the accurate wave number coverage as widely as possible.

nan,"In general, the ion exchange capacity (IEC) is closely related to the proton conductivity of PEMs because the acid functionalities, such as sulfonic acid groups, contribute to the proton conduction in a membrane. Beyond a certain sulfonation degree, PEMs tend to absorb too much water or are even soluble in water, which negatively affect their mechanical resistance and water resistance [17,18]. Therefore, the improvement of proton conductivity using aromatic polymers with moderately adjusted IEC values has been under intense investigation [19–23]. To achieve high proton conductivity with moderate IEC values, the formation of ion channel structures, which enable effective proton conduction, has been studied. In the course of these studies, an ideal morphology has been pursued by microphase separation of segmented block copolymers in which hydrophilic sulfonated polymer segments form an interconnected three-dimensional network responsible for efficient proton transport, while a complementary network of hydrophobic non-sulfonated segments imparts a reinforcing effect, preventing excessive swelling in water and enhancing the mechanical properties. An image of the ideal morphology for PEMs is shown in Fig. 2.

nan,"Our procedure does not address the issue of how parameterizations can vary for different flow types. However, Edeling et al.  [9] carried out separate calibrations for a set of 13 boundary-layer flows. They summarized this information across calibrations by computing Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. This approach is helpful, but it might be extended further by modelling proximity across flows through a distance that would relate to the flow characteristics in order to borrow strength across calibrations instead of splitting the calibrations and then merging the outcomes afterwards. This is a challenging but attractive venue for future research.

nan,"Recently together with structural efficiency, passenger safety is also an important issue in application of material to transportation industries. Hence, the crashworthiness parameters are introducing to predict the capability of structure to prevent the massive damage and protect the passenger in the event of a crash. Crashworthiness parameters for various thin-walled tubes made from metal or fibre/resin composites in different geometries have been studied. A critical difference of tubular composites failure modes compared with metallic is the brittle collapse. In addition, in composites, tubular failure modes are involved with micro-cracking development, delamination, fibre breakage, etc., instead of plastic deformation. Implementation of composite materials in the field of crashworthiness is attributed to Hull, who in 80s and 90s of the last century studied extensively the crushing behaviour of fibre reinforced composite material. He found that the composite materials absorbed high energy in the face of the fracture surface energy mechanism rather than plastic deformation as observed for metals [1]. This observation has inspired others to further investigation about crashworthiness characteristics of composite materials. Studies have examined the axial crushing behaviour of fibre-reinforced tubes [2], fibreglass tubes [3,4], PVC tubes [5] and carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) tubes [6].

nan,"PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) has become by far the most popular material in the academic microfluidics community because it is inexpensive, easy to fabricate by replication of molds made using rapid prototyping or other techniques, flexible, optically transparent, biocompatible and its fabrication does not require high capital investment and cleanroom conditions. Various techniques have been adapted to fabricate microfluidic structures in PDMS, including wet and dry etching [20–22], photolithographic patterning of a photosensitive PDMS [23], and laser ablation [24]. But, it was the “soft-lithography” techniques [25] introduced by Whitesides et al. that enabled the widespread use of PDMS and opened up the era of PDMS-based microfluidics in the late 1990s. Replica molding, which is the casting of prepolymer against a master and generating a replica of the master in PDMS, has become a standard fabrication technique available in almost every research laboratory. Detailed overviews of soft-lithography techniques and their applications can be found from the reviews by McDonald et al. [26] and Sia et al. [27]. Nowadays, many tools dedicated for this purpose are available and can be purchased as a complete set (e.g. SoftLithoBox® provided by Elveflow (USA) [28]). Moreover, companies, such as FlowJEM (Canada) [29], Microfluidic Innovations (USA) [30], and Scientific Device Laboratory (USA) [31] provide rapid prototyping service for PDMS-based LOC devices.

nan,"The first step of PB, the enumeration of the conditional sample space through abductive logic programming, could be compared to “logical inference” in ProbLog [9]. While both languages aim to generate a propositional formula and compile it into a decision diagram, “logical inference” in PB is based on abductive logic programming, while ProbLog grounds the relevant parts of the probabilistic program. Moreover, in PB compilation of the boolean formulas is performed using (RO)BDDs, while ProbLog can use a wider range of decision diagrams, e.g. sentential decision diagrams (SDD), deterministic, decomposable negation normal form (d-DNNF). These differences reflect the different aims of the two PPLs: ProbLog focuses on models where “logical inference” needs to be efficient, and the resulting representation, the decision diagrams, need to be compact, while PB focuses on models where “logical inference” is typically easy, however it must be applied repeatedly, according to the nature and the number of the observations.

nan,"The dynamics of various physical phenomena, such as the movement of pendulums, planets, or water waves can be described in a variational framework. The development of variational principles for classical mechanics traces back to Euler, Lagrange, and Hamilton; an overview of this history can be found in [1,19]. This approach allows to express all the dynamics of a system in a single functional – the Lagrangian – which is an action integral. Hamiltonian mechanics is a reformulation of Lagrangian mechanics which provides a convenient framework to study the symmetry properties of a system. This is expressed by Noether's theorem which establishes the direct connection between the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian systems and conservation laws. When one approximates the system numerically, it is advantageous to preserve the Hamiltonian structure also at the discrete level. Given that Hamiltonian systems are abundant in nature, their numerical approximation is therefore a topic of significant relevance.

Meanwhile, we showed that the performance of the learning algorithms can be improved by using feature extraction methods that rely on the angular information of muscle activation patterns. Features such as the TD-PSD and the DFT proved more successful than others in reducing the impact of the two dynamic factors that we considered in this paper. Such features can be readily implemented into a prosthesis controller for real-time control, especially that the EMG pattern recognition systems are nowadays becoming available for clinical testing, e.g. the COAPT complete control system (Kuiken et al., 2014)11https://www.coaptengineering.com/.

nan,"The scheduling process we adopt matches a multiple stage stochastic programming approach. Standard two-stage stochastic programs with linear or convex functions are often solved using the L-shaped method or Bender's decomposition [44,6,7]. However, our recourse decision (scheduled cancellations) is still anticipative to further uncertainty, namely the second shift surgery durations, unavailability and cancellations. As such, the decision problem can be viewed as a three-stage recourse model [5,6]. Solving the scheduling problem is further complicated because the recourse function is integer. Laporte and Louveaux [26] propose modified L-shaped decomposition with adjusted optimal cuts for two stage stochastic program with integer recourse. Angulo et al. [1] alternately generate optimal cuts of the linear sub-problem and the integer sub-problem, which improves the practical convergence (see also [15,8]). We follow a sample average approximation approach (SAA) which uses this framework. Moreover, we prove and exploit a specific relationship between the first-stage realization and the optimal number of scheduled cancellations to speed up the computation of integer cuts. We use Jensen's inequality [17] to upper bound the minus second (and third) stage cost, a technique that was proposed by Batun et al. [3].

nan,"The observed conductivity of A2FeMoO6–δ (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) [7] was linked to a potential double exchange mechanism, with conduction between Fe3+-O-Mo-O-Fe2+. Double-exchange mechanisms, as proposed by Zener [23], posit that electron transfer between ions in different oxidation states may be facilitated if the electron does not have to alter its spin state. Replacement of Mo with Fe in this mechanism would be expected to result in a reduction of the conductivity through reduction of the available percolation pathways, unless delocalisation of Fe electrons through Fe2+-O-Fe3+ exchange could also occur. Double exchange mechanisms have been observed previously for mixed valent iron in iron oxides [24], and, as iron is known to exist in a mixed valent state for Ca2–xSrxFeMoO6–δ [25], this provides a plausible explanation for the observed metallic conductivity.

Investment casting is one of the most economical methods to produce titanium and titanium aluminide alloy products, increasing the components' integrity and mechanical properties, whilst reducing material waste and machining cost [1]. Titanium aluminides are difficult to process mainly due to the low fluidity of the TiAl alloy around its melting temperature [2]. Due to the high affinity of elements such as oxygen, nitrogen etc., titanium and its alloys can easily interact with mould materials during the investment casting process, resulting in an interaction hardened layer being generated at the metal surface [3,4].

The designed nonlinear predictive controller using Hammerstein model make good use of the ability of universal approach nonlinear of T-S model, and divide the question of nonlinear predictive control into the nonlinear model recongnization and the question of linear predictive control.

nan,"Another important reason for the damages incurred by the RC buildings is workmanship defects. It is understood that granulometry of the handmade concretes was not in compliance with the standards since the aggregate utilized in them was not sieved. Also the compaction process was not properly implemented in general in the installment of concrete in RC buildings. This situation resulted in the concrete to exhibit an excessively porous structure. The most fundamental rules of thumb of construction, namely concrete cover, was not taken care of in formwork workmanship. Faults in the connections of stirrups to the longitudinal bars, unstaggered formation of stirrup hooks in beams and columns, the perpendicular angles of the hooks, inadequately anchorage lengths of the stirrup hooks and longitudinal bars, and the use of cold joints were the other frequently encountered workmanship defects (Figs. 19–22).

nan,"Alternatively to H-atom photodetachment from the intermediate radicals, the latter may serve as reducing agents. Evidence has been reported in recent years that the pyridinyl radical (PyH) is an exceptionally strong reducing agent which can even reduce CO2 to formaldehyde, formic acid or methanol with suitable catalyzers [27–29], albeit the mechanisms of these reactions are currently poorly understood [30–32]. The theoretically predicted dissociation thresholds of the AcH, AOH and BAH radicals are about 2.7eV, 2.5eV and 3.0eV, respectively (see Fig. 4), while the predicted dissociation threshold of the pyridinyl radical is much lower, about 1.7eV [1]. Pyridinyl is thus a significantly stronger reductant than acridinyl and related radicals. It is therefore not expected that the latter will be able to reduce carbon dioxide in dark reactions.

nan,"To conclude, the electrochemical reduction of uranium dioxide to uranium metal has been studied in a lithium chloride–potassium chloride eutectic molten salt at 450°C. Both electrochemical and synchrotron X-ray techniques have been utilised to deduce the electrochemical reduction potential, mechanism and reduction pathway. The electrochemical reduction potential of the UO2|U couple is dependent on the activity of oxide ions existing within the melt. The electrochemical reduction of uranium dioxide to uranium metal seems to occur in a single, 4-electron-step, process; indicated by a single reduction peak (C1) in the cyclic voltammograms and also by the exclusion of any other phases in the EDXD data. The electrochemical reduction may be impeded by an increase in oxo-acidity of the molten salt. That is, O2− ions that are liberated by the electroreduction may not react at the counter electrode and, thus, not be removed from the molten salt. This could be due to the electrode geometry and/or the inherent microstructure of the working electrode: a high tortuosity, for example, would impede the diffusion of O2− ions out of the working electrode. This could then cause an increase in the activity of oxide ions existing within the melt and hence inhibit the electrochemical reduction – exploration of the microstructure of working electrodes will be the focus of future work.

nan,"SPM, and AFM in particular, has been widely applied to questions in polymer crystallization. The technique has several strengths that make it ideally suited for such studies. It is a high resolution technology, routinely resolving sub 10nm features [13,14], and hence allowing the fundamental length scale of the polymer lamellar crystal, its thickness, to be observed. AFM requires no staining or metal coating of the sample, so sample preparation is relatively straightforward. Also, it is non-destructive under many circumstances. This allows images to be obtained while a process such as crystal growth or melting is occurring, giving time-resolved data at lamellar or sub-lamellar resolution [15–18]. It is this final feature that provides many of the most exciting possibilities of AFM for studying polymer crystallization, as it is now possible to watch crystal growth, crystal melting, and re-organisations within crystals at the lamellar scale, seeing how structure evolves and local conditions influence kinetics. AFM has a wide range of different measuring modes, and, with the ever increasing number of functional semicrystalline polymers available (e.g. [19]), the breadth of experiments that can be carried out with a single machine is also one of the techniques attractions.

nan,"Social network gaming, which refers to playing games that are connected to social networking services (SNS) directly, or through mobile applications (apps), is a popular online activity. Social network games (SNG) are generally free-to-play and do not award monetary prizes, but users can make in-game purchases to advance within the game, customise the game, give gifts to friends, and access other exclusive benefits and features, leading to these games being referred to as ‘freemium’. Although SNG are connected to a SNS and encourage users to interact with their connections, most SNG can be played without any social interaction. SNG have grown rapidly in popularity and the global SNG market is predicted to grow annually at 16% from 2013 to 2019 to reach a total market value of US$17.4 billion (Transparency Market Research, 2015). A survey of Facebook users in Australia in November 2012 reported that there are over 3.5 million social gamers across Australia and almost 70% play SNG daily (Spiral Media, 2013), and it is highly likely that the use of SNG has increased since this time.

nan,"Up to now, morphological studies of the multi-component polymeric materials have been carried out by various microscopic and scattering methods. Optical microscopes, transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) and atomic force microscopes (AFMs) are commercially available and widely used. The biggest advantage of microscopy is that they provide intuitive real-space representations of the various morphologies. However, when it comes to “measurements”, especially in a quantitative way, microscopy sometimes lacks a statistical accuracy due to the small field of view. In contrast, the scattering methods provide much a superior statistical accuracy than that of microscopy simply because the observation volume is larger than that of the microscopes. One must remember, however, that the scattering methods normally require “(hypothesized) models” for data analysis in advance: They do not provide an intuitive insight into the morphologies as does microscopy. After all, for the complete characterization of a specific morphology, one may need to first know the morphologies from the microscopy and subsequently to evaluate the structural parameters by scattering on the basis of the morphology; the two methods are complementary.

nan,"In this Letter, we present results of a relativistic calculation of decay constants in the framework of full Salpeter equation. The full Salpeter equation is a relativistic equation describing a bound state. Since this method has a very solid basis in quantum field theory, it is very good in describing a bound state which is a relativistic system. In a previous paper [16], we solved the instantaneous Bethe–Salpeter equation [17], which is also called full Salpeter equation [18]. After we solved the full Salpeter equation, we obtained the relativistic wave function of the bound state. We used this wave function to calculate the average kinetic energy of the heavy quark inside a heavy meson in 0− state, and obtained values which agree very well with recent experiments. We also found there that the relativistic corrections are quite large and cannot be ignored [16]. In this Letter we use this method to predict the values of decay constants of heavy mesons in 0− state.

However, to the best of the authors' knowledge no study so far reported experiments with both techniques being applied on the same films at the same temperature. This contribution reports the results of a study applying EIS and IEDP to one and the same La0.6Sr0.4CoO3−δ (LSC) thin film in order to get complementary results on the resistive contributions of the oxygen reduction kinetics on such films. As electrical measurements require an oxygen ion conductor, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was used as substrate for LSC films with two different grain sizes.

nan,"HOMO–LUMO energy band gaps between ylides and their pyrene adducts propose that the 1,3-DC of second pyridinium ylides to ylidepyrene adducts are HOMOylide–LUMOylide–pyrene controlled since the energy band gap is smaller than HOMOylide–pyrene–LUMOylide. Regioselectivity of second cycloaddition was predicted using the atomic orbital coefficients corresponding to HOMOylide–LUMOylide–pyrene. According to Fukui [33], reactions can be favorable in the direction of maximal HOMO–LUMO overlapping of larger coefficients at the reactive sites. The most favorable interactions between corresponding ylides and ylidepyrene adducts to form the most favorable regioisomer conformation are given in Fig. 3. Second ylide addition to ylidepyrene structure is therefore anticipated to proceed via ylideC2/C6–ylidepyrene-C3 and ylideC7–ylidepyrene/C2 interactions to produce the same regioisomer conformations. Considering the theoretical calculations performed for pyrrolidine attached pyrene structure, it is also expected that formation of the same type of regioisomers are favorable for SWNTs after the 1,3-DC of pyridinium ylides, Fig. 3.

nan,"The other methods for enhancement of photocatalytic activity are grafting co-catalysts. There are two kinds of co-catalysts in terms of its function: one is for separation of electrons and the other is for separation of holes. The former representative co-catalysts are Pt, Fe3+, and Cu2+ [9–12]. It was reported that Fe3+ and Cu2+ were grafted as amorphous oxide cluster [9,10], and reduced into Fe2+ and Cu+ by receiving one electron, respectively [11,12]. The reduced metal oxide cluster with reduced ions could return into the original state by giving more than one electron to molecular oxygen. The latter ones are CoOx, CoPi (CoPOx), IrOx, and RuOx which are used for water oxidation, among which CoPi is reported to be the most effective co-catalyst for water oxidation [13]. However, there were few reports concerning co-grafting effects on photocatalytic activity especially in gaseous phase. We expected that by co-grafting of both co-catalysts for separations of electrons and holes, photocatalytic activity in gaseous phase would be further enhanced.

nan,"An innovative sound wall system was developed in the University of Western Ontario, and was examined to serve as a vertical extension to the existing sound walls. The wall system (denoted as flexi-wall) consists of stay-in-place poly-blocks as formwork, light polyurethane foam (LPF) reinforced with steel rebars as structural cores and polyurea as a coating of the wall surfaces (Fig. 1). Poly-blocks are interlocking light-weight blocks which are stacked up layer by layer and act as formwork for the LPF cores. The poly-block is 20×20×80cm3 and includes four cylindrical voids with 14cm diameter. It is made of molded low-density polyurethane and weighs approximately 1kg. The poly-blocks are fire-resistant blocks and have an excellent capability to absorb, mitigate and reflect a wide range of noises with unmatched frequency of reflective noise. Polyurea coating is an abrasion-resistant finishing layer, which is sprayed on the surfaces of the wall and sets within 2–3min. This layer also enhances the surface resistance of poly-blocks against stone impact, weathering, fire development, chemicals and penetration. LPF is an expanding liquid mixture which is injected into the poly-block voids and cures within 10min. Steel rebars are epoxied into holes drilled in the existing sound wall to connect the wall extension to its base.

nan,"Each hit position inside the drift chambers was calculated from the drift time digitized by a flash analog-to-digital converter. The calculation was carried out based on a relation between the hit position and the drift time (x–t relation). The x–t relation was precisely calculated by a drift chamber simulation package, GARFIELD [20], and a gas property simulation package, MAGBOLTZ [21]. Although the chambers were constructed carefully with a tolerance of 100 μm, there was a small position deviation of wires and field-shaping patterns, which could locally modify the electric field. In order to take account of the limited accuracy in the chamber manufacturing, a correction was commonly applied to the calculated x–t relation throughout the experiments. The correction was obtained to minimize the χ2 in the fitting of straight tracks of clean muon events observed on the ground without magnetic field. The correction was as small as expected from the accuracy in the chamber manufacturing. During the observations, the x–t relation was affected by the variation in the pressure and temperature of the chamber gas. In order to take account of these time-dependent variations, the x–t relation was calibrated for each data-taking run. Especially in calibrating the x–t relation of ODCs, an absolute reference positions were provided by SciFi, which are not affected by the variation in the pressure nor temperature.

nan,"Microhardness can be related to other macroscopic mechanical properties such as yield stress, σ, and elastic modulus, E, both derived from compression testing. For work-hardened metals, Tabor derived a direct proportionality between hardness and compressive yield stress: H≈3σ [20]. However, it was soon realized that Tabor's relationship only applies to materials that exhibit full plasticity [9,10]. Deviations from this relationship have been reported for a number of metals, glasses and polymers where the elastic strains are non-negligible [9]. Hence, the different expressions describing the correlation of hardness with conventional macroscopic mechanical properties rely on the validity of the above-mentioned elasto-plastic models. In this way, hardness and yield stress no longer hold direct proportionality but their relationship depends on the specific material properties, such as Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus [9,11–13]. It has been shown that these elasto-plastic models not only satisfactorily explain an H/σ ratio of ≈2 for a number of polyethylene materials of different nature, but also theoretically account for the range of H/E ratios experimentally determined [21].

nan,"The purported advantages of EMR implementation in urban slums are widely promoted. Increasingly capable health information systems could facilitate communication, help coordinate care, and improve the continuity of care in disadvantaged communities like Kibera. However, available systems may not have the ability to simplify care or improve efficiency where funding and human resources are scarce, infrastructure is unreliable and health data demands are opportunistic, not strategic. This study described perceptions of local EMR stakeholders in two urban slum clinics. They shared many observations that may be important for other EMR initiatives to heed, and worried most about the sustainability of EMR initiatives in like communities. The future for EMR use in urban slums is promising. Innovative new technologies, such as mobile applications and point-of-care laboratory tests, could extend the reach of EMRs where infrastructure is wanting. New cloud-based EMR ecosystems, where data is collected and stored centrally could leverage cell phone networks to promote more health information sharing, coordination of care and ultimately better outcomes for vulnerable populations.Summary pointsWhat was already known on the topic?•Rapid urbanization is associated with growth in the number and size of urban slums and an associated rise in the burden of disease, further worsening an already fragmented and inefficient health care system.

nan,"DPD was first proposed in order to recover the properties of isotropy (and Galilean invariance) that were broken in the so-called lattice-gas automata method [5]. In DPD, each body is regarded as a coarse-grained particle. These particles interact in a soft (and short-ranged) potential, allowing larger integration timesteps than would be possible in MD, while simultaneously decreasing the number of degrees of freedom required. As in Langevin dynamics, a thermostat consisting of well-balanced damping and stochastic terms is applied to each particle. However, unlike in Langevin dynamics, both terms are pairwise and the damping term is based on relative velocities, leading to the conservation of both the angular momentum and the linear momentum. The property of Galilean invariance (i.e., the dependence on the relative velocity) makes DPD a profile-unbiased thermostat (PUT) [6,7] by construction and thus it is an ideal thermostat for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [8]. The momentum is expected to propagate locally (while global momentum is conserved) and thus the correct hydrodynamics is expected in DPD [8], as demonstrated previously in [9]. Due to the aforementioned properties, DPD has been widely used to recover thermodynamic, dynamical, and rheological properties of complex fluids, with applications in polymer solutions [10], colloidal suspensions [11], multiphase flows [12], and biological systems [13]. DPD has been compared with Langevin dynamics for out-of-equilibrium simulations of polymeric systems in [14], where as expected the correct dynamic fluctuations of the polymers were obtained with the former but not with the latter.

nan,"In this section we wish to calculate the cross section for the absorption of massless scalars by the self-dual string in the world volume of the M-theory five-brane. We will adopt an entirely world volume approach similar to that of [21–23]. We begin by writing the equation satisfied by the s-wave with energy ω, φ(r,t)=φ(r)eiωt, of the linear fluctuations of the four overall transverse scalars about the self-dual string, (it is known that there are problems when one considers higher angular momentum modes [23], one must take care with the validity of the linearized approximation, this is discussed in [13]): (15)ρ−3ddρρ3ddρ+1+R6ω6ρ6φ(ρ)=0, where ρ=rω, R=Q1/3ℓp. Note, as pointed out by [11] world volume solitons have a much sharper potential than the Coulomb type potential typical of brane solutions in supergravity; thus this scattering is different to that of the string in six-dimensional supergravity. Nevertheless, for small ωR one may solve this problem by matching an approximate solution in the inner region to an approximate solution in the outer region; this follows closely the supergravity calculation [24].

nan,"Fig. 9 displays the growth of two of the main corrosion products that develop or form on the surface of Cu40Zn with time, hydrozincite (Fig. 9a) and Cu2O (Fig. 9b). It should be remembered that both phases were present already from start of the exposure. The data is presented in absorbance units and allows comparisons to be made of the amounts of each species between the two Cu40Zn surfaces investigated, DP and HZ7. The tendency is very clear that the formation rates of both hydrozincite and cuprite are quite suppressed for Cu40Zn with preformed hydrozincite (HZ7) compared to the diamond polished surface (DP). In summary, without being able to consider the formation of simonkolleite, it can be concluded that an increased surface coverage of hydrozincite reduces the initial spreading ability of the NaCl-containing droplets and thereby lowers the overall formation rate of hydrozincite and cuprite.

nan,"Generalized polynomial chaos expansions. One approach to model densities with stochastically dependent components numerically, is to reformulate the uncertainty problem as a set of independent components through generalised polynomial chaos expansion [34]. As described in detail in Section 3.1, a Rosenblatt transformation allows for the mapping between any domain and the unit hypercube [0, 1]D. With a double transformation we can reformulate the response function f asf(x,t,Q)=f(x,t,TQ−1(TR(R)))≈fˆ(x,t,R)=∑n∈INcn(x,t)Φn(R),where R is any random variable drawn from pR, which for simplicity is chosen to consists of independent components. Also, {Φn}n∈IN is constructed to be orthogonal with respect to LR, not LQ. In any case, R is either selected from the Askey-Wilson scheme, or calculated using the discretized Stieltjes procedure. We remark that the accuracy of the approximation deteriorate if the transformation composition TQ−1∘TR is not smooth [34]. Dakota, Turns, and Chaospy all support generalized polynomial chaos expansions for independent stochastic variables and the Normal/Nataf copula listed in Table 2. Since Chaospy has the Rosenblatt transformation underlying the computational framework, generalized polynomial chaos expansions are in fact available for all densities.

nan,"Anodizing processes are widely used for protecting aluminium alloys against corrosion [1]. The resultant films are composed of amorphous alumina and consist of a relatively thick, porous, outer region and a thinner, non-porous, inner region [2,3]. The porous region contains the major pores of the film, which extend from the film surface to the barrier layer. Near the film surface, shorter, incipient pores are also present, whose growth stopped in the early stages of anodizing. The diameter of the major pores and the thickness of the inner, barrier region are dependent on the potential applied during anodizing, with typical proportionalities of ∼1nmV−1 [3,4]. Studies of ionic migration in barrier-type and porous anodic alumina films have usually found a transport number of O2− ions of ∼0.6 [5,6]. During the formation of porous films, the outward migrating Al3+ ions, constituting the remainder of the ionic current, are ejected to the electrolyte at the pore bases [7]. The electronic current in the barrier region is generally considered to be negligible. The thickness of the barrier region, which is relatively constant during the growth of a film under either a constant potential or constant current density, is maintained by a balance between growth of the barrier layer by continued oxidation of the aluminium substrate and thinning of the barrier layer by either field-assisted dissolution of the alumina at the pore bases [8] or field-assisted flow of alumina from the barrier layer to the pore walls [9–13]. The pores may be widened toward the film surface by chemical dissolution to an extent dependent on the anodizing conditions.

nan,"FR schemes are similar to nodal DG schemes, which are arguably the most popular type of unstructured high-order method (at least in the field of computational aerodynamics). Like nodal DG schemes, FR schemes utilise a high-order (nodal) polynomial basis to approximate the solution within each element of the computational domain, and like nodal DG schemes, FR schemes do not explicitly enforce inter-element solution continuity. However, unlike nodal DG schemes, FR methods are based solely on the governing system in a differential form. A description of the FR approach in 1D is presented below.

nan,"Owing to widespread availability, the most extensively adopted tomography technique utilizes the milling power of a focused ion beam (FIB) in conjunction with the imaging capabilities of high resolution FE-SEM, to provide a sequence of 2D images that can be effectively re-combined in 3D space. However, because this technique is destructive, studies of microstructural evolution are influenced by inherent sample variability. Non-destructive X-ray nano-computed tomography (CT) [9–11] provides a platform for exploring dynamic microstructural change in the absence of these possible complications and is compatible with both laboratory and synchrotron radiation. The authors have previously demonstrated a technique for preparation of optimal sample geometries for X-ray nano-CT [12], while this FIB sample preparation route will involve the selective removal of portions of the fuel cell electrode microstructure (and therefore may be destructive to the working fuel cell), the non-destructive X-ray characterization technique allows repeated, non-destructive characterization of the selected sample which facilitates the study of microstructural evolution processes in response to various environmental changes.

nan,"For any quantum dynamical method, existing or emerging, reliable benchmarks are required to assess their accuracy. A model Hamiltonian exhibiting tunnelling dynamics through a multidimensional asymmetric double well potential has been used as a test by the MP/SOFT [18] and CCS methods [19] mentioned above, and also more recently by a configuration interaction (CI) expansion method [20] and two-layer version of CCS (2L-CCS). [21] The Hamiltonian consists of a 1-dimensional tunnelling mode coupled to an (M−1)-dimensional harmonic bath, hence it is a system-bath problem which bears some similarity to the Caldeira-Leggett model of tunnelling in a dissipative system [22,23]. This Hamiltonian is non-dissipative, however and the harmonic modes all have the same frequency. System-bath models play an important role in physics, being used to describe superconductivity at a Josephson junction in a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) [24], for which the Caldeira-Leggett model provides a theoretical basis, and magnetic and conductance phenomena in the spin-bath regime [25].

nan,"Note that the presented architecture works at the frame level, meaning that each single frame (plus its corresponding context) is fed-forward through the network, obtaining a class posterior probability for all of the target languages. This fact makes the DNNs particularly suitable for real-time applications because, unlike other approaches (i.e. i-vectors), we can potentially make a decision about the language at each new frame. Indeed, at each frame, we can combine the evidence from past frames to get a single similarity score between the test utterance and the targetlanguages. A simple way of doing this combination is to assume that frames are independent and multiply the posterior estimates of the last layer. The score sl for language l of a given test utterance is computed by multiplying the output probabilities pl obtained for all of its frames; or equivalently, accumulating the logs as:(6)sl=1N∑t=1Nlogp(Ll|xt​, θ)where p(Ll|xt​, θ) represents the class probability output for the language l corresponding to the input example at time t, xt by using the DNN defined by parameters θ.

Fig. 17 shows the temperature profile during the recycling of the CPA pill and subsequent operation at 200mK. During the hold time, the servo control program maintained the CPA pill temperature to within a millikelvin. It is expected that microkelvin stability can be achieved with fast read-out thermometry (which was not available at the time of testing but which will be used for the mKCC), as this would allow for temperature control on much faster (millisecond) timescales than the current (approximately 1s) thermometry readout used.

(2004) using measurements from their multiple probes (92 over an axial length of 2.325 m) obtained time/axial position/void fraction information. From this they were able to identify huge wave from amongst disturbance waves and slugs. They classified individual structures as huge waves from their size together with the fact that their velocities depended significantly on the corresponding axial length. This was in contrast to disturbance waves where the velocity of individual waves only increased slightly with the axial extent of these waves. They also found that the frequency of huge waves first increased and then decrease with increasing gas superficial velocity. Similarly, their velocities were found to deviate from the line for slug flow velocities and pass through a maximum and then a minimum.

Therefore, the antigens were labeled with pHrodo Red dye (Invitrogen), a dye that specifically fluoresces as pH decreases from neutral to acidic, as provided in endosomes/lysosomes of cells. In vitro characterization of the cellular uptake of neoglycocomplexes using bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) demonstrated superior ingestion of mannan-conjugates MN–Ova and MN–Pap (Supplementary Fig. S4A-D,F). This was confirmed in vivo by intradermal needle-injection of labeled antigen into the ear pinnae of mice. Antigen uptake and transport to the ear dLNs were measured after 24h by FACS analysis. DCs in cervical LNs were identified according to their high expression of MHC class II (Fig. 3A) and additionally characterized by CD8α, CD11b, and CD11c expression and uptake of pHrodo-labeled antigen (Fig. 3B, D–F). The results showed significantly elevated numbers of pHrodo+MHCIIhigh DCs for mannan conjugates MN–Ova and MN–Pap (and to a lesser degree for MD–Pap) in comparison to the unmodified antigens (Fig. 3C). Both carbohydrates targeted antigen preferentially to CD8α− DCs, as indicated by an increase in CD8α−/pHrodo+ DCs compared to unmodified antigens (Fig. 3E and F). Nevertheless, whether the antigens were taken up in situ by dermal DCs or by LN resident APCs via the afferent lymphatics could not be fully elucidated.

nan,"Our simulations confirm experimental observations that W net erosion represents only tiny fraction (in our simulation ∼1%) of the W gross erosion. The estimated upstream W fluxes, FWupstrem, are in good agreement with the experimentally observed values ⩽1019m-2s-1 [16]. Moreover, this value is not very sensitive to the divertor plasma temperature. For low temperatures the energy of D and C ions hitting to the divertor plates is too low to sputter sufficient amount of W. With increasing energy the W sputtering increases, but the potential drop in the divertor plasma increases too. As a result, most of the W atoms are ionized in the vicinity of the divertor and return back to the plates. There are two effects leading to the observed prompt redeposition of W ions: first is the “near-divertor” ionization of W due to low ionization potential −7.86eV (for comparison the ionization potentials for D and C are 13,6 and 10.6eV), second, W+n ions have large Larmor radius ∼2/nmm, so that they are redeposited within the distance of a Larmor radius. Important to note that a significant fraction of W ions escaping this prompt redeposition are returned back due to the friction with the main ions.

nan,"Despite the ubiquity of time-dependent dynamical systems in nature, there has been relatively little work done on the analysis of time series from such systems. Mathematically they are known as non-autonomous systems, which are named as such because, unlike autonomous systems, in addition to the points in space over which they are observed they are also influenced by the points in time. Recently there has been much work on the direct ‘bottom-up’ approach to these systems, which includes the introduction of a subclass known as chronotaxic systems that are able to model the stable but time-varying frequencies of oscillations in living systems  [8,9]. In contrast, the time series analysis of these systems, referred to as the inverse or ‘top-down’ approach, has not been studied in detail before. This is partly because non-autonomous systems can still be analysed in the same way as other types of systems in both the deterministic  [10] and the stochastic  [11] regime. However, it is now argued that this type of analysis is insufficient and that an entirely new analytical framework is required to provide a more useful picture of such systems. In the case of chronotaxic systems some methods have already been developed for the inverse approach and they have shown to be useful in analysing heart rate variability  [12]. A general and dedicated procedure for analysing non-autonomous systems has still not been tackled though.

nan,"The pipes under pressure in the RCS or connected to RCS are usually made of austenitic or austenitic & ferritic stainless steel. Most connections are welded. The pipes may be exposed to various degradation phenomena (diverse hazards, mechanical fatigue, thermal fatigue, stress corrosion, etc.). Event screening in the databases showed a total of 116 events (33 related to cracks and 83 to leaks). Three main causes for failure were identified, namely, fatigue, corrosion and the presence of manufacturing defects. Human factor induced defects proved to have little impact – less than 10% of the cases could be attributed to operation errors. Fatigue was found being induced by several factors: excessive vibration, pressure shocks and the thermal regime of operating the pipe, as well as by combinations of these factors. Corrosion was induced, in most of the cases, by a non-appropriate choice of alloys while not taking into account the chemical parameters of the fluid inside pipes. Manufacturing defects mostly dealt with welding related problems and deviation from the design documentation during post-weld heat treatment.

nan,"It should be noted that BEBC [21] and NOMAD [20] observed a discrepancy between experimental ρ rates and those estimated with JETSET [16]. NOMAD [20] proposed to retune some of the parameters used within JETSET to obtain better agreement. Therefore, for the purpose of this analysis events were simulated both with the default setting and with the setting proposed by NOMAD of key JETSET parameters, taking an average between them as a result and half a difference as a systematic error. We used experimental rates of light neutral mesons and resonances where available (Table 1) for normalization purposes. The uncertainty introduced by the JETSET parameter settings (which amounts to 20% at most) affects only the production of the η′ and ϕ for which no experimental data are available. This uncertainty is reflected in the error quoted in the table. However, since the contribution from η′ and ϕ is small, the overall effect is less important.

nan,"The particular phase field model we employ is an extension of [6], and is based on the three dimensional thermal phase field model of [7] and two dimensional thermal-solutal phase field model of [8]. One feature of the physical problem is that it is purely dissipative, or entropy increasing, as all natural relaxational phenomena are. The resulting PDEs are of Allen–Cahn [9] and Carn–Hilliard type [10]. That is to say, the model involves time derivatives of the three fields coupled to forms involving variational derivatives of some functional – typically the free energy functional. As the dendrite grows the free energy reduces monotonically with time but never achieves equilibrium if the domain boundary is far from the dendrite. Although we have listed some of the difficult aspects of this model, the relaxational aspect is typically an asset and results in stable numerical schemes: there is no convection, for example (at least in the absence of flow in the melt).

nan,"Assuming a constant cell electrical conversion efficiency of 15%, a constant fraction of the incident solar radiation would be dissipated by the solar cell for each solar radiation intensity level. From Table 2, it can be seen that for the worst scenario when the ambient temperature was 50°C with natural convection only, the predicted cell electrical conversion efficiency would have reduced to approximately 8% rather than the 15% assumed. The energy dissipated as heat from the cell would thus be 7% higher. To correct for this effect the apparent insolation level should be modified using the following formula:(3)Iact=I×0.850.85+dηwhere Iact is the actual incident solar radiation intensity, dη is solar cell efficiency difference between the initially assumed 15% and final calculated cell efficiency based on measured cell temperature.

nan,"The goal of the glued trees (GT) algorithm for quantum search is the following: beginning from the left-most vertex of a given GT graph, traverse the graph and reach the right-most vertex, referred to as the target vertex. Childs et al. [1] use this algorithm to show quantum walk search to be fundamentally more effective than classical random walk search by presenting a class of graphs (the GT graphs) that force classical random walks to make exponentially many queries to an oracle encoding the structure of the graph, but that are traversable by quantum walks with a polynomial number of queries to such an oracle. In order to study the robustness of the algorithm to the detrimental effects of decoherence, we shall determine how effectively it achieves its goal when subjected to an increasing degree of phase damping noise. For this reason, we will focus on the probability that the walker is on the target vertex at the end of the walk. We thus consider GT graphs such as the one illustrated in Fig. 1(b), i.e. consisting of n layers before the gluing stage, and thus labelled as G′n.

The spin-on carbon compositions were dissolved in a suitable solvent such as chloroform or anisole with a concentration in the range 5–50g/l. In this report, film thickness measurements were made for IM-HM11-01 and IM-HM11-02 films, whilst IM-HM11-03 was used for etching; further investigations to compare the performance of the different compositions across tasks are underway. Films of the SoC were prepared by spin coating on hydrogen-terminated silicon substrates with a speed varying between 800 and 2000 RPM for 60s. After spin coating the film was baked for 2min at temperatures of up to 330°C. In order to enable further processing, the SoC should be rendered insoluble in typical solvents for resist and spin-on-hardmask to enable further processing. The elution behavior of films of IM-HM11-01 and IM-HM11-02 for thicknesses between 30 and 325nm was tested as a function of the baking temperature. Fig. 1 shows the normalized film thickness of two formulations of the SoC (IM-HM11-01 and IM-HM11-02), before and after dipping in monochlorobenzene (MCB):IPA 1:1 solution. Prior to baking the thickness of IM-HM11-01 was ∼320nm, and the thickness of IM-HM11-02 was ∼250nm. For temperatures above 190°C the IM-HM11-02 film was rendered insoluble, whilst a temperature of 260°C was required to achieve the same for IM-HM11-01.

nan,"Shading can be the most detrimental factor on performance for a domestic system. The impact of shading on performance varies depending on the electrical series and parallel arrangement of cells within a module and modules within an installed array. Whilst many approaches to shading analysis have been proposed, computational efficiency is not reported despite being of high importance when incorporating shading algorithms into an overall energy yield model. The lack of consideration of the non-linear impacts of shading on smaller systems for example means that the shading loss is significantly underestimated, especially from supposedly small obstacles such as antennas or chimneys. As an example, the system shown in Fig. 1 illustrates the case where the installer may have attested a shade loss factor close to unity under UK microgeneration guidelines (Microgeneration Certification Scheme, 2013), i.e. negligible, but the performance of the system is severely compromised due to the non-linear cell mismatch effects. An effective shading sub-model therefore needs to give feedback to inform decisions of array layout in the proximity of obstructions but must not rely on high power computing.

nan,"One of the challenges in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the relativistic bound state problem. In the light-cone Hamiltonian approach [1] light-cone wave functions can be constructed in a boost invariant way. It is necessary to have reliable light-cone wave functions if one wants to calculate high energy scattering, especially exclusive reactions. Many parametrizations assume separability of the dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse momentum which is very unlikely since the two momenta are coupled in the kinetic energy operator. Various approaches have been tried to compute such wave functions. One can use the usual equal time Hamiltonian [2] and transform the resulting wave functions into light-cone form with the help of kinematical on-shell equations. The light-cone Hamiltonian in a string picture is formulated in Ref. [3]. More ambitious is the construction of an effective Hamiltonian including the gauge degrees of freedom explicitly and then solving the bound state problem. For mesons this approach [4,5] still needs many parameters to be fixed. Attempts have been made to solve the valence quark wave function for mesons in a simple Hamiltonian with a two-body potential [6].

nan,"This conclusion is a consequence of the high jet speeds and small nozzle diameters in combination with the relatively high viscosity solvent and modest molecular weights of the polystyrene, which results in high Weissenberg numbers and moderate values of the extensibility, L studied here. As discussed in earlier papers [3,6], other jetting fluid combinations, such as those of de Gans et al. [4], lie in a different jetting regime where full extension does not occur and relaxation time controls the viscoelastic behaviour. Consequently inkjet fluid assessment methods need to provide a full characterisation including both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties. This complexity suggests assessments of inkjet fluids might have to include jetting from sets of DoD print head devices with different sensitivities to all the various VE parameters [37], rather than reliance on testing without jetting. This was not the expected outcome from the present work but does echo the very pragmatic viewpoint expressed as a “map of misery” by Clasen et al. [38] and may provide a way forward for future R&D strategies towards ink testing.

nan,"Although the presented model is developed and tested with a-C:H layers in mind, it is not necessarily limited to them. Moreover, the only assumptions are chemical reactions between the gas and the solid forming volatiles, the loss of these volatiles from the material and the two stated boundary conditions of gas influx at a single outer surface and the possibility of reactions throughout the bulk. Porosity and significant gas inventories were observed not only for carbon [12] but, e.g. also for beryllium co-deposits [25] and can be expected for other co-deposits formed in plasma devices [1]. Thus, TCR and its description by the presented model may be applicable to all deposits. If a layer has constituents that are not forming volatiles with the reactive gas, e.g. W and Be with O2, these constituents cannot be removed by TCR, as they will not be removed from the deposit. This can influence the removal of other deposit constituents and the time evolution of the process can change. The new understanding of TCR may, for the first time, allow applying the method in a controlled way to nuclear fusion devices, possibly solving the tritium retention issue especially related to carbon based materials.

nan,"The first-principles calculations are performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [21] which implements the plane-wave pseudopotential DFT method. The exchange correlation functional is approximated using the generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) [22], and the electron–ion interactions are described by Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials [23]. The plane wave basis set is truncated at a cutoff of 400eV, and the Brillouin-zone sampling was performed using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme with a k-point spacing in reciprocal space of 0.04Å−1. Tests show that these computational parameters give results that are sufficiently accurate for present purposes. The ferromagnetism of nickel is accounted for by performing all calculations using spin polarization, starting at a ferromagnetic initial configuration and relaxing towards its ground state. However, for all compositions considered, the ground state electronic structure of each alloy is found to exhibit only very weak ferromagnetism, and the effect is not thought to influence their phase stability. Table 1 shows the calculated equilibrium lattice constants of the η phase at various Ti concentrations, using partially ordered ηP structures. The change in lattice constant upon Ti alloying is relatively small, but can be related to the ∼10% larger covalent radius of Ti.

nan,"The second stress state is a tri-axial tensile stress designed to represent the zone ahead of an advancing crack tip. Micro-scale lateral cracks have been observed in the oxide layer, and appear to form very close to or at the metal–oxide interface (Fig. 1). Finite element analysis by Parise et al. indicated that these cracks form as a result of localised tensile stresses above peaks in the metal–oxide interface roughness [31]. These cracks are considered separate to any nano-scale cracks that might result from the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. An assumption is made here that whether the micro-scale lateral cracks form via fracture of the oxide or by de-bonding at the interface a triaxial tensile stress state will still be present. In manufactured partially stabilised zirconia cracks would be expected to destabilise the tetragonal phase. This is simulated by applying tensile stress in direction 1, 2 and 3. As this the maximum stress at the crack tip is not known, the applied tensile stresses cover a range from 0.1GPa up to a maximum stress value of 2.2GPa as it is approximately equal to three times the fracture strength of bulk fracture strength for manufactured stabilized zirconia [34]. For the biaxial compressive and triaxial tensile stress states it is the trends in behaviour rather than the absolute values that are considered of greatest importance for this work.

nan,"We have developed a systematic, quantified understanding of a specific problem: the design of mobile-friendly unique identifiers. But our results also apply to the design of other text-based services. There has been a trend toward bespoke and adaptive keyboards (e.g., Dunlop and Levine, 2012; Karrenbauer and Oulasvirta, 2014; Leiva et al., 2015; Wiseman et al., 2013). More often than not, though, input devices are a fixed constraint in the design of a service. Most users are typing on the keyboard that came with their phone. Those keyboards have advantages, limitations and quirks. The mode-switching that most touchscreen keyboards require to reach numbers and capital letters is at the root of design improvements we propose in this paper. When designing services, it is vital to be aware of the fixed constraints of a system and to then focus on the aspects of a service's design that can be controlled. Making changes to input data in this way is a cheap, quick and easy way to improve user experience.

nan,"MWSN routing protocols generally take influence from both WSN and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols, which all share common limitations, such as bandwidth, power and cost. WSNs often share the same aim as MWSNs, in that they wish to route data from many sensors to a single sink. However, WSNs are normally considered to be static and so the associated routing protocols are often unable to cope in a mobile scenario [10]. Alternatively, MANET protocols are designed to be able to cope with the mobility of nodes, however they aim to allow end-to-end communication to occur between any two nodes [2]. This extra functionality is often not required by MWSNs and so the additional overhead is unnecessary. Combined with the high packet delivery ratios and low delays that are demanded by emerging applications, the ideal routing solution for a MWSN is one that can handle the mobility of nodes and allows data to be forwarded from the sensors to the sink in a reliable and timely manner. This set of requirements make the problem of routing in a MWSN a unique challenge, which will require new specifically designed solutions. For this reason there have been many routing protocols designed for MWSNs. As such, this section will give an overview of the current literature, which highlights the different techniques and commonly used protocols in MWSN routing.

nan,"We propose an equilibrium model that allows to analyze the long-run impact of the electricity market design on transmission line expansion by the regulator and investment in generation capacity by private firms in liberalized electricity markets. The model incorporates investment decisions of the transmission system operator and private firms in expectation of an energy-only market and cost-based redispatch. In different specifications we consider the cases of one vs. multiple price zones (market splitting) and analyze different approaches to recover network cost—in particular lump sum, generation capacity based, and energy based fees. In order to compare the outcomes of our multilevel market model with a first best benchmark, we also solve the corresponding integrated planner problem. Using two test networks we illustrate that energy-only markets can lead to suboptimal locational decisions for generation capacity and thus imply excessive network expansion. Market splitting heals these problems only partially. These results are valid for all considered types of network tariffs, although investment slightly differs across those regimes.

nan,"Failure of structural components is a major concern in the nuclear power industry and represents not only a safety issue, but also a hazard to economic performance. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and especially intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC), have proved to be a significant potential cause of failures in the nuclear industry in materials such as Alloy 600 (74% Ni, 16% Cr and 8% Fe) and stainless steels, especially in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWR) [1–5]. Stress corrosion cracking in pressurized water reactors (PWSCC) occurs in Alloy 600 in safety critical components, such as steam generator tubes, heater sleeves, pressurized instrument penetrations and control rod drive mechanisms [2,6,7]. Understanding the mechanisms that control SCC in this alloy will allow for continued extensions of life in current plant as well as safer designs of future nuclear reactors.

nan,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the particle shape on interacting particles flowing in a horizontal turbulent channel flow, for particles with a significant Stokes number. To achieve this, large eddy simulations (LES) of a horizontal turbulent channel flow laden with five different particle shapes, incorporating the drag, lift and toque model derived in Zastawny et al. (2012), are performed. The well-documented horizontal channel flow case described in Kussin and Sommerfeld (2002), who study spherical particles, is used as a reference case. The measurements in their work was done with phase Doppler anemometry (PDA), to measure the fluid and particle velocity simultaneously. The numerical framework applied in this paper has been previously validated for spherical particles in Mallouppas and van Wachem (2013). In that paper, it is shown that the comprehensive discrete element model (DEM) is more accurate in determining the behaviour of the particles in this horizontal gas–solid channel flow that the hard-sphere model. Moreover, this paper showed that the fluid mechanics are accurately modelled using the LES framework. In the current paper, this framework is extended to account for non-spherical particles.

nan,"The data acquisition strategies must balance the relevant scales and volumes of the datasets to be used in the physical and statistical modeling. Approaches for extraction of the necessary information must be able to disregard spurious information, so as to develop a working network of models for each active mechanism related to each degradation pathway on the mesoscopic physical level and the data-driven statistical model level. To capture the temporal evolution of the energy material over long time frames, appropriate informatics methods are needed to balance data volume (e.g., simple univariate time-series data streams with high-dimensional volumetric imaging datasets) while considering their respective information contents [68,69]. The raw data and extracted information must be accessible for query and modeling. Similarly, the modeling approaches used to understand and parameterize active mechanisms and phenomena over lifetime fall into the broad categories of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches. Laboratory and real-world experimentation, informatics, analytics, and the development of network models for mesoscopic evolution of energy materials over lifetime together constitute the field of degradation science.

nan,"In the Total Focusing Method (TFM) the beam is synthetically focused at every point in the target region [7] as follows. After obtaining the FMC data, the target region, which is in the x–z plane in 2D (Fig. 1), is discretized into a grid. The signals from all elements in the array are then summed to synthesize a focus at every point in this grid. Linear interpolation of the time domain signals is necessary since they are discretely sampled. The intensity of the TFM image ITFM at any point (x,z) is given by:(10)ITFM(x,z)=|∑HTR(1c((xT−x)2+z2+(xR−x)2+z2))|forallT,Rwhere HTR(t) is the Hilbert transform of a signal uTR(t) in the FMC data, xT is the x-position of the transmitting element (T) and xR is the x-position of the receiving element (R). Note that the z-position of all elements is zero (Fig. 3a). The summation is carried out for all possible transmitter–receiver pairs and therefore uses all the information captured with FMC.

nan,"A bond failure is thought of as a micro-crack nucleation, specifically as a separation between the adjacent cells in the cellular structure along their common face. Initially, the micro-cracks may be dispersed in the model reflecting the random distribution of pore sizes and the low level of interaction due to force redistribution. Interaction and coalescence may follow as the population of micro-cracks increases. These situations are illustrated in Fig. 3. The structure of the failed surface can be represented with a mathematical graph, where graph nodes represent failed faces and graph edges exist between failed faces with common triple line in the cellular structure, i.e. where two micro-cracks formed a continuous larger crack. With reference to Fig. 3, each failed face is a graph node and each pair of neighbouring failed faces is a graph edge.

The accuracy of the prediction and detection models was 96.6% and 84.1%, respectively. The stress feedback provision model offers positive or negative stress feedback for each spoken word by comparing the probability of the predicted stress pattern with that of the detected stress pattern.

nan,"The proposed multihop routing protocol, PHASeR, applies the technique of blind forwarding in a MWSN, which increases the reliability of data delivery through its inherent use of multiple routes. This approach requires a gradient metric to be continuously maintained, which is problematic in a dynamic topology. The literature commonly uses either flooding or location awareness, however flooding creates large amounts of overhead and location determination schemes can often be inaccurate, power hungry and create the issue of the dead end problem. PHASeR uses a novel method of gradient maintenance in a mobile network, which requires the proactive sharing of only local topology information. This is facilitated by a global TDMA (time division multiple access) MAC (medium access control) layer and further reduces the amount of overhead, which in turn will decrease packet latency. PHASeR is also set apart by its use of encapsulation, which allows data from multiple nodes to be transmitted in the same packet in order to handle high volumes of traffic. It utilises node cooperation to create a robust multipath routing solution. As such, the contribution of this paper is a cross-layer routing protocol for MWSNs that can handle the constant flow of data from sensors in highly mobile situations.

nan,"Apache Pig is a platform for creating MapReduce workflows with Hadoop. These workflows are expressed as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks that exist at a conceptually higher level than their implementations as series of MapReduce jobs. Pig Latin is the procedural language used for building these workflows, providing syntax similar to the declarative SQL commonly used for relational database systems. In addition to standard SQL operations, Pig can be extended with user-defined functions (UDFs) commonly written in Java. We adopted Pig for our implementation of the correlator to speed up development time, allow for ad hoc workflow changes, and to embrace the Hadoop community׳s migration away from MapReduce towards more generalized DAG processing (Mayer, 2013). Specifically, in the event that future versions of Hadoop are optimized to support paradigms other than MapReduce, Pig scripts could take advantage of these advances without recoding, whereas explicit Java MapReduce jobs would need to be rewritten.

nan,"The research work in this paper elaborates on the theoretical effectiveness of the proposed method based on the multivariate EMD. It also clearly indicates through numerical simulations and applications to bearing monitoring that the expansion from standard EMD to multivariate EMD is a successful exploration. Using multiple sensors to collect signal from different locations of the machine and using the multivariate EMD to analyze multivariate signal can contribute to comprehensively collect all the frequency components related to any bearing fault, and is beneficial to extract fault information, especially for early weak fault characteristics. Both the characteristic frequencies of simulated signal and the fault frequencies of practical rolling bearing signal can be extracted from the same order of IMF groups, thus showing that multivariate EMD is an effective signal decomposition algorithm and can be competently applied to fault diagnosis of rolling bearings when combined with a multiscale reduction method and fault correlation factor analysis. In signal acquisition and processing, given the circumstance that there is a trend toward the use of multiple sensors, multivariate EMD appears to be very useful and meaningful as a kind of multivariate data processing algorithm. By analyzing the simulated signal and two different practical multivariate signals, the results demonstrate the significance of the proposed method in the field of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing.

nan,"Isogeometric analysis. The central idea of isogeometric analysis is to use the same ansatz functions for the discretization of the partial differential equation at hand, as are used for the representation of the problem geometry. Usually, the problem geometry Ω is represented in computer aided design (CAD) by means of NURBS or T-splines. This concept, originally invented in  [1] for finite element methods (IGAFEM) has proved very fruitful in applications  [1,2]; see also the monograph  [3]. Since CAD directly provides a parametrization of the boundary ∂Ω, this makes the boundary element method (BEM) the most attractive numerical scheme, if applicable (i.e., provided that the fundamental solution of the differential operator is explicitly known). Isogeometric BEM (IGABEM) has first been considered for 2D BEM in  [4] and for 3D BEM in  [5]. Unlike standard BEM with piecewise polynomials which is well-studied in the literature, cf. the monographs  [6,7] and the references therein, the numerical analysis of IGABEM is essentially open. We only refer to  [2,8–10] for numerical experiments and to  [11] for some quadrature analysis. In particular, a posteriori error estimation has been well-studied for standard BEM, e.g.,  [12–18] as well as the recent overview article  [19], but has not been treated for IGABEM so far. The purpose of the present work is to shed some first light on a posteriori error analysis for IGABEM which provides some mathematical foundation of a corresponding adaptive algorithm.

The LSMB is mounted on flexures which provide flexibility in the horizontal direction so that the majority of the lateral force is transmitted though the much stiffer load path which contains the load cell as shown in Fig. 2. Both displacement and load sensors have been calibrated (both externally and in-situ) in static conditions. The load and displacement signals are sampled at a rate of two hundred measurements per fretting cycle at all fretting frequencies, with these data being used to generate fretting loops. The loops were used to derive the contact slip amplitude and the energy coefficient of friction in each cycle according to the method suggested by Fouvry et al. [17]. Average values for these were calculated for each test (the average coefficient of friction included values associated with the initial transients in the tests as suggested by Hirsch and Neu [18]).

nan,"The main drawback of thermo-oxidation in most actual devices and ITER is its limitation to maintenance periods, when the vessel walls can be heated up around 300–400 °C by hot helium injection through the cooling system [19,20], and also because of the required reconditioning of the walls before plasma operation to remove the absorbed oxygen [10]. However, the temperature achieved is not homogeneous over the vessel, as it is limited to the distance to the cooling tubes, and thus to the device design. The analysis of this study is a continuation of previous works done for the treatment of ITER carbon co-deposits [1–3], so the temperatures studied are in the range of 350 °C for divertor and 200–275 °C for main wall and remote parts. At present, due to budget restrains as well as due to tritium trapped in co-deposited carbon layers, ITER will not use carbon materials at the divertor strike points in spite of their excellent resilience against large heat loads. Nevertheless, many present experimental nuclear fusion devices (DIII-D, TCV, etc.) and new ones (JT-60SA, KSTAR, Wenderstein-7X) use carbon elements, so the removal of carbon co-deposits is still necessary for a better device operation—plasma density control, dust events, etc. The temperatures used in this work are not very different from the ones achievable in present devices, such that the results can be extrapolated to them. Moreover, even for ITER this study could be useful if carbon materials have to be eventually installed in the case that operation with tungsten tiles at the strike points is precluded by unexpected reasons.

nan,"The most widely used ion source in FIB instruments is a gallium (Ga) liquid metal ion source (LMIS) [1]. Gallium is attractive as an ion source because of its low melting temperature (29.8°C at standard atmospheric pressure [4]) and its low volatility [1]. However, some materials show sensitivity to the Ga ion beam. This sensitivity is manifested as changes in the structure and chemical composition of the starting material upon exposure to the Ga ion beam [5]. Group III–V compound semiconductors are one class of materials that show such sensitivity. Cryo-FIB milling has recently been reported to suppress the reactions between the Ga ion beam and III–V materials [6]. The suggested advantage of cryo-FIB milling over room temperature milling of Group III–V materials is appealing, given the variety of present and potential future applications for these materials (e.g., as electronic or photonic devices given the favorable electron transport and direct band gap properties associated with several III–V semiconductor systems).

nan,"The viscoelastic behavior of elastomers containing small amounts of unattached chains has been investigated to characterize the dynamics of the polymer chains trapped in fixed networks [66–68]. Polymer chains trapped in fixed networks constitute a simpler system for the study of the polymer chain dynamics than the corresponding uncrosslinked polymer melts. This is because the complicated effect of the motion of the surrounding chains on the dynamics of the probe chain – called “constraint release” [69] – is absent in the fixed network systems. Most of the earlier studies employed randomly crosslinked elastomers as host networks. In this case, precise control of the mesh size of the host networks is not possible, and the mesh size has a broad distribution. The end-linking systems give the host networks a more uniform mesh size, and they can control the mesh size by the size of the precursor chains. We investigated the dynamic viscoelasticity of end-linked PDMS elastomers containing unattached linear PDMS as functions of the size of the unattached chains (Mg) and the network mesh (Mx) (Fig. 9a) [70]. We employed two types of host networks with Mx>Me and Mx<Me where Me (≈10,000 for PDMS) is the molecular mass between adjacent entanglements in the molten state. The Mx>Me and Mx<Me networks (designated as NL and NS, respectively) were designed by end-linking the long (Mn=84,000) and short precursor chains (Mn=4,550), respectively. The mesh of the NL networks is dominated by trapped entanglements, while that of the NS network is governed by chemical cross-links.

nan,"It has been known [9,14,18,22] that the fragmentation processes in polyatomic molecules induced by an intense ultrafast laser field can sometimes exhibit sensitive dependence on the instantaneous phase characteristics of the laser field. Depending on the change in sign the chirped laser pulses, fragmentation could be either enhanced or suppressed [14,18,22]. Controlling the outcome of such laser induced molecular fragmentation with chirped femtosecond laser pulses has brought forth a number of experimental and theoretical effects in the recent years. However, efforts are continuing for a specific fragment channel enhancement, which is difficult since it also is a function of the molecular system under study [20,22–24]. Here we report the observation of a coherently enhanced fragmentation pathway of n-propyl benzene, which seems to have such specific fragmentation channel available. We found that for n-propyl benzene, the relative yield of C3H3+ is extremely sensitive to the phase of the laser pulse as compared to any of the other possible channels. In fact, there is almost an order of magnitude enhancement in the yield of C3H3+ when negatively chirped pulses are used, while there is no effect with the positive chirp. Moreover, the relative yield of all the other heavier fragment ions resulting from interaction of the strong field with the molecule is not sensitive to the sign of the chirp, within the noise level.

nan,"Another remarkable feature of the quantum field treatment can be revealed from the investigation of the vacuum state. For a classical field, vacuum is realized by simply setting the potential to zero resulting in an unaltered, free evolution of the particle's plane wave (|ψI〉=|ψIII〉=|k0〉). In the quantized treatment, vacuum is represented by an initial Fock state |n0=0〉 which still interacts with the particle and yields as final state |ΨIII〉 behind the field region(19)|ΨI〉=|k0〉⊗|0〉⇒|ΨIII〉=∑n=0∞t0n|k−n〉⊗|n〉 with a photon exchange probability(20)P0,n=|t0n|2=1n!e−Λ2Λ2n The particle thus transfers energy to the vacuum field leading to a Poissonian distributed final photon number. Let's consider, for example, a superconducting resonant circuit as source of the field. The magnetic field along the axis of a properly shaped coil is well approximated by the rectangular form. A particle with a magnetic dipole moment passing through the coil then interacts with the circuit and excites it with a measurable loss of kinetic energy even if the circuit is initially uncharged and there is classically no field it can couple to. The phenomenon that vacuum in quantum field theory does not mean to “no influence” as known from Casimir forces or Lamb shift is clearly visible here as well.

nan,"Based on the theoretical analysis, the value of the measuring resistor, Rm, has no effect on the corrosion process and on the estimated value of noise resistance. In order to validate this conclusion, the experiment of Fig. 9 was performed. Specifically, a pair of nominally identical specimens was initially coupled by a 4.7kΩ resistor and their potential with respect to a saturated calomel electrode was recorded by using a NI-USB 6009 analog-to-digital converter. The electrochemical noise signal was recorded using in-house developed software, acquiring at 1023Hz segments of 1000 points at each iteration. Between iterations, the 1000 values acquired were averaged to obtain a single value of potential, subsequently saved to the file used for later processing. The final dataset comprised potential values spaced 1±0.05s in time. Under the assumption that the noise present above 1023Hz is negligible compared with the noise present below 0.5Hz, this procedure enables an accurate recording of the potential noise in the frequencies of interest, avoiding aliasing of frequencies between 0.5 and 1023Hz and minimizing the 50Hz interference from the mains supply.

In a majority of safety analyses the prediction of reactor physics responses is performed using neutron diffusion theory applied to three-dimensional systems, with inputs usually derived from deterministic neutron transport solutions of two-dimensional lattice geometries. There has been increased activity related to uncertainty and sensitivity in reactor physics calculations, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development – Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD-NEA) has sponsored an ongoing benchmark entitled “Uncertainty Analysis in Modelling” (UAM) related to these efforts.

nan,"An obvious metric to measure the monitoring performance between the different conditions would be to compare how many clicks the users made in average for each condition. Furthermore of interest are the buffer values of the respective buffers at the time of the user's interaction with the simulation (e.g., the input buffer of a certain machine at the time of refilling it). A relatively high average buffer value can e.g. signify that the users do not trust that the respective mode of process monitoring conveys the need for interaction in time, leading the users to switching their attention to the process simulation in regular intervals, and performing interactions just in case. A low average buffer can, on the other hand, signify that the users rely on the respective conditions’ ability to signal interaction needs. On the other hand, if e.g. an input buffer had already been completely depleted at the time of intervention, this may signify that the respective condition has failed to inform the users in time. In many cases, participants used double clicks for their interactions, while a single click would have been sufficient, a fact that was perhaps not communicated clearly enough to the participants. Therefore, if several clicks were performed directly one after another, only the first click was taken into account.

nan,"Progressive photon mapping was first proposed by Hachisuka et al. (2008) as an iterative extension of the standard static photon mapping approach as implemented in the Radiance extension. It combines multiple smaller photon maps to approximate a much larger one which may not fit into memory using the traditional approach. Through iteration, the process mitigates the noise inherent in Monte Carlo raytracing by combining successive results and averaging them. At the same time, the density estimate bandwidth1Bandwidth describes the support, or area of influence, of a filter used to weight the photons retrieved from the photon map during a nearest neighbour lookup on a surface (Jensen, 2001). The resulting irradiance is proportional to the photon density, and the bandwidth is defined by the distance (radius) to the furthest photon found. In this paper, we generalise the term to describe either the radius or the number of nearest neighbours for a density estimate, depending on the implementation.1 (radius or number of nearest photons) is gradually reduced to mitigate bias. As Hachisuka points out, the accumulated density estimates converge to an unbiased solution in the limit.

nan,"A living polymerization is a reaction without transfer and termination reactions that can proceed up to complete monomer conversion. In addition, when initiation is quantitative and fast compared to the propagation reaction, polymers with precisely controlled chain length and narrow molar mass distribution can be obtained. In the case of an industrial styrene polymerization this would permit to avoid any specific washing or degassing steps, which are necessary in the radical process to remove residual monomer and low molar mass oligomers. Since head-to-head defects along the chains are absent, anionic polystyrene would exhibit also a better thermal stability than radical one. Therefore, production of anionic polystyrene (PS) would be of interest if the conditions required to control the polymerization could be adapted to the market and be able to compete economically with industrial radical processes. The use of organic solvents and of expensive alkyllithium initiators, as well as the relatively low reaction temperatures required, was some important limitation to overcome. The possibilities to achieve a quantitative living-like anionic polymerization of styrene in the absence of solvent and at elevated temperature, using inexpensive initiating systems, were the main targets identified to tremendously decrease the cost of the anionic process. This implied at first to control the reactivity and stability of initiating and propagating active species in such unusual operating conditions.

We then apply the coupled approach to biochemical and mechanical conditions typical for postmenopausal osteoporosis (Section 4) and microgravity exposure (Section 5), and discuss key sensitivity features (Section 6).

nan,"From a general point of view, polymerization techniques can be divided into two types of chemical reactions: step-growth polymerization and free radical polymerization. Step-growth polymerization is widely used for synthesis of polyesters, polyamide and epoxies while the synthesis of polyacrylics requires the use of free radical polymerization. These polymerization reactions can be performed either in bulk or in solution or in dispersed media. Heterophase polymerizations (i.e. emulsion, dispersion and miniemulsion polymerizations) present the advantage of easier removal of the resulting product from the reactor compared to bulk polymerization thanks to the low viscosity of the reaction medium. Polymerization in solution also induces lower viscosity but also lower reaction rates due to dilution of the reactants and higher cost and environmental impact due to the use of organic solvents. These problems are solved in the case of heterophase polymerizations where the reactants are confined inside droplets (no dilution effect) and water is used as medium. The use of surfactant molecules are usually needed for the stabilization of the monomer droplet and subsequent polymer particles in the water phase.

nan,"Prior to assembling the miniature ADR, the mKCC MR heat switch could not be fully thermally characterised due to cryostat constraints. However, based on experiments and research conducted at MSSL on a range of tungsten heat switches, the thermal conductivity has been estimated. In Hills et al. [8], an equation is derived which allows the thermal conductivity (κ) below 6K to be calculated as a function of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T) (see Eq. (1)). To estimate the performance of the mKCC heat switch, the parameters in Eq. (1) have been taken from the measured thermal conductivity of another MSSL heat switch with the same 1.5mm square cross section, a free path length of 43cm and a RRR of 20,000; it has been observed from experiments conducted at MSSL that there is little change in the thermal performance for tungsten heat switches with a RRR between 20,000 and 32,000 (subject of a future publication) and therefore the performance of the 20,000 RRR heat switch has been assumed to be a good approximation.

nan,"The test cases confirm that the high-order discretisation retains exponential convergence properties with increasing geometric and expansion polynomial order if both the solution and true surface are smooth. Errors are found to saturate when the geometric errors, due to the parametrisation of the surface elements, begin to dominate the temporal and spatial discretisation errors. For the smooth solutions considered as test cases, the results show that this dominance of geometric errors quickly limits the effectiveness of further increases in the number of degrees of freedom, either through mesh refinement or higher solution polynomial orders. Increasing the order of the geometry parametrisation reduces the geometric error. The analytic test cases presented here use a coarse curvilinear mesh; for applications, meshes are typically more refined in order to capture features in the solution and so will better capture the geometry and consequently reduce this lower bound on the solution error. If the solution is not smooth, we do not expect to see rapid convergence. In the case that the solution is smooth, but the true surface is not, then exponential convergence with P and Pg can only be achieved if, and only if, the discontinuities are aligned with element boundaries. However, if discontinuities lie within an element, convergence will be limited by the geometric approximation, since the true surface cannot be captured. In the cardiac problem, we consider both the true surface and solution to be smooth.

The present work is confined to relaxation mechanisms which result from changes in normal stresses. More specifically, we are interested in the local mechanisms of irreversible energy loss caused by uniform compression or expansion of a medium for which all components remain unchanged, rather than the losses caused by friction between different layers of a medium which move with different velocities (for a more detailed discussion of this issue see [26]).

A certain degree of parameter degeneracy in terms of overall performance is expected as a consequence of the conformal nature of the EOS description [132]. In our current work, we use an alternative CG mapping for n-alkanes developed in reference [122], where each segment was taken to represent three alkyl carbon backbone atoms and their corresponding hydrogen atoms. By applying this mapping, n-alkanes chains containing multiples of three carbon units can be represented directly: n-C6H14, n-C9H20, n-C12H26, n-C15H32, n-C18H38, etc. A good description of the thermodynamic properties of these alkanes is found to be provided with CG alkyl beads characterised by the Mie (15–6) potential. For convenience, the exponent pair (15–6) is also used to represent the interactions between the CG beads of the intervening alkanes considered here; the number of segments m is taken to be the nearest integer of the division of the carbon number C by three. The size σ and energy ∊ parameters are then estimated from the experimental saturated-liquid density and vapour pressure of the individual alkanes following the usual SAFT-γ Mie procedure. The chosen mapping is by no means unique, as one can postulate parameter sets that fulfil other requisites, such as being “universal” across the entire homologous series [119] or correlated to the critical properties [125].

nan,"Another choice was to graft the fluorinated groups on the copolymers with functional groups. Casazza et al. [52] synthesized an acrylic terpolymer with pendent perfluoroether segments via grafting fluorinated groups into a poly(butyl methacrylate-co-hydroxyehtyl acrylate-co-ethyl acrylate) random copolymer through hexamethylene diisocyanate functionality. Malshe et al. [53,54] studied the coating properties of fluorinated acrylic copolymers based on MMA, BA, and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). They partially esterified hydroxyl functionality of HEMA with tetrafluoro propanoic acid and cured the polymer with butylated melamine formaldehyde resin. Such methods were suited for the synthesis of copolymers containing complicated fluorinated groups or difficult to be provided directly by living polymerization.

nan,"The GFRFs of nonlinear systems can be determined by either a parametric-model-based method or a nonparametric-model-based method [8]. In the parametric approach, a nonlinear parametric model is first identified from the input–output data. The GFRFs are then obtained by mapping the resultant model into the frequency domain using the probing method [9]. The nonparametric approach is often referred to as frequency-domain Volterra system identification and is based on the observation that the Volterra model of nonlinear systems is linear in terms of the unknown Volterra kernels, which, in the frequency domain, corresponds to a linear relation between the output frequency response and linear, quadratic, and higher order GFRFs. This linear relationship allows the use of a least squares (LS) approach to solve for the GFRFs. Several researchers [10–12] have used this method to estimate the GFRFs. But they usually made the assumption that it is known a priori that the system under study can be represented by just two or three terms. However, such information is rarely available a priori.

nan,"A hydroxyl-functionalized poly(butylene succinate) based polyester was prepared by conventional polycondensation of benzyl-protected dimethyl malonate and 1,4-butanediol (Scheme 2(a)) [24a]. Yao et al. reported on the direct polycondensation of l-lactic acid and citric acid with the formation of poly[(l-lactic acid)-co-(citric acid)], obtaining a polyester oligomer with both pendant carboxylic and hydroxyl groups [24b]. This PLCA oligomer was reacted with dihydroxylated PLLA as a macromonomer, yielding a PLCA–PLLA multiblock copolymer as shown in Scheme 2(b). While lipases have been investigated for the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic ester monomers [25,26], they have also been used for the preparation of polyesters by polycondensation reactions. The advantage of this technique is that these enzyme-catalyzed reactions proceed without protection of the pendant functional groups. In this field, hydroxyl-bearing polyesters have been synthesized by the copolymerization of divinyl adipate with various triols (e.g. glycerol, 1,2,4-butanetriol) as represented in Scheme 2(c) [27] and by copolymerizations of 1,8-octanediol with adipic acid and several alditols [28]. Very recently, several α-hydroxy acids derived from amino acids were homo- and copolymerized with lactic acid by polycondensation in bulk without protected monomers (Scheme 2(d)) [29].

nan,"The spins and parities of Θ+ and Ξ−− are not yet known experimentally. In this new wave of pentaquark research, most theoretical papers take the spin equal to 1/2. The parity is more controversial. In chiral soliton or Skyrme models the parity is positive [4]. In constituent quark models it is usually positive. In the present approach, the parity of the pentaquark is given by P=(−)ℓ+1, where ℓ is the angular momentum associated with the relative coordinates of the q4 subsystem. We analyze the case where the subsystem of four light quarks is in a state of orbital symmetry [31]O and carries an angular momentum ℓ=1. Although the kinetic energy of such a state is higher than that of the totally symmetric [4]O state, the [31]O symmetry is the most favourable both for the flavour–spin interaction [12] and the colour–spin interaction [13]. In the first case the statement is confirmed by the comparison between the realistic calculations for positive parity [12] and negative parity [14], based on the same quark model [15]. In Ref. [12] the antiquark was heavy, c or b, and accordingly the interaction between light quarks and the heavy antiquark was neglected, consistent with the heavy quark limit. In Ref. [16] an attractive spin–spin interaction between s̄ and the light quarks was incorporated and shown that a stable or narrow positive parity uudds̄ pentaquark can be accommodated within such a model. This interaction has a form that corresponds to η meson exchange [17] and its role is to lower the energy of the whole system.

nan,"According to the ellipsometric spectra, optical constants and other physical parameters can be extracted by an appropriate fitting model. In order to estimate the optical constants/dielectric functions of Ni-doped TiO2 films, a three-phase layered system (air/film/substrate) [15] was utilized to study the ellipsometric spectra. TiO2 belongs to the wide band gap semiconductors. Considering the contribution of the M0 type critical point with the lowest three dimensions, its dielectric function can be calculated by Adachi's model [15,22,23]: ε(Ε)=ε∞+{A0[2−(1+χ0)1/2−(1−χ0)1/2]}/(EOBG2/3χ02). In the model, E is the incident photon energy, ε∞ is the high-frequency dielectric constant, χ0=(E+iΓ), EOBG is the optical gap energy, and A0 and Γ are the strength and broadening parameters of the EOBG transition, respectively. As an example, the experimental SE of the film TN1 at an incident angle 70° by dot scatter is shown in Fig. 4. The Fabry–Pérot interference oscillations due to multiple reflections within the film have been found in the photon energy from 1.5eV to 3.5eV (354nm–826nm), which indicates that the films are transparent in this region. Note that a good agreement of the experimental and calculated spectra is attained in the whole measured photon energy range. The fitting thickness for film TN2 is 159nm, which is very near to the value obtained by SEM (see Fig. 1(b)).

nan,"Ge (100) wafers (n- and p-type) were cleaned in ultra high vacuum (<10−6mbar) at 500°C and 600°C for 10min to evaporate any native oxide and so achieve an oxide free surface. Subsequently, wafers were exposed to an Al flux for a range of times to deposit ultrathin Al layers. The samples were then oxidized at ambient temperatures in the MBE load lock to produce Al2O3 layers. The samples were transferred within 1min to an Oxford Instruments OpAL reactor and thin films of HfO2 were deposited on the Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The HfO2 depositions used a [(CpMe)2HfOMeMe] precursor coupled with an O2 plasma as the oxidizing species. Between 30 and 130 ALD cycles were used to grow HfO2 thicknesses from 1.6 to 7nm at 250°C. For electrical measurements, circular gold contacts of area 1.96×10−3cm2 were deposited onto the films to form MOS gate electrodes and Al was deposited on the back of the Ge wafers to provide an ohmic contact.

nan,"The most ambitious goal may be stated as the one of detecting the location of, say, one missing level on an otherwise complete sequence. Dyson, in a recent review [7], uses information theory concepts and argues that correlations in a sequence may provide the necessary redundancy from which error correcting codes can be constructed. At one extreme where no correlations and therefore no redundancy are present (Poissonian sequence), there is no possibility of detecting one missing level. At the other extreme, a sequence of equally spaced levels (picket fence), there is a maximum redundancy and a missed level can be obviously detected as a hole in the spectrum. Eigenvalues of random matrices, which exhibit characteristic correlations, correspond to an intermediate situation between these two extremes. The attempts to locate in the last case a single missed level have remained unsuccessful so far. However, it should be mentioned that for two-dimensional chaotic systems where, besides correlations of the order of one mean spacing as described by random matrices, the presence and the role of long range correlations governed by the shortest periodic orbits and reflected in Weyl's law describing the average spectral density, is well understood. It is then possible to approximately locate, from the study of spectral fluctuations, a single missed level [8].

nan,"Numerical simulation of the gas flow through such non-trivial internal geometries is, however, extremely challenging. This is because conventional continuum fluid dynamics, which assumes that locally a gas is close to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, becomes invalid or inaccurate as the smallest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the channel height) approaches the mean distance between molecular collisions, λ [1]. An accurate and flexible modelling alternative for these cases is the direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) [2]. However, DSMC can be prohibitively expensive for internal-flow applications, which typically have a geometry of high-aspect ratio (i.e. are extremely long, relative to their cross-section). The high-aspect ratio creates a formidable multiscale problem: processes need to be resolved occurring over the smallest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. a channelʼs height), as well as over the largest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the length of a long channel network), simultaneously.

Our calculation is applicable in the phase when the fields are rolling. This rolling phase will start when the Hubble constant drops to a value comparable to the mass of the scalar fields. It is at this time in the cosmological evolution that CP violation is most efficient. After the fields have relaxed to their vacuum values, our CP violation mechanism turns off. We plan to discuss more details, in particular applications to concrete baryogenesis models, in a future publication [20]. Note that string cosmology and brane world scenarios may provide natural settings for the origin of the scalar fields required for our mechanism (e.g. see Ref. [30] for a recent paper on how scalar fields from brane world scenarios can play a new role in spontaneous baryogenesis).

nan,"Plastically deformed MGs develop inhomogeneity and show harder and softer regions [16]. While this could in principle be associated with a BE according to the composite model, a MG provides no basis for a dislocation-based theory. The search for a BE in plastic flow is hindered by the softening of MGs associated with shear-banding (in contrast to the work-hardening familiar in conventional alloys). Anelastic deformation is, however, of interest as its time-dependence must relate to relaxation processes in the MG structure that in turn should be connected to the onset of plasticity. In particular, anelasticity may offer a way to study the operation of the shear transformation zones (STZs [17]) often used to interpret the deformation of MGs. Fujita et al. have used torsion tests to observe anelasticity in MGs loaded (at maximum, on the cylindrical sample surface) to 30%, 16% and just 4% of the shear yield stress τy [18]. In the present work we apply torsion to MG samples to reach stresses up to 24% of τy, and for the first time in the elastic regime investigate the effects of torque reversal.

nan,"To calculate hedonic price indices in the linear model, the initial or reference price has to be calculated (Triplett, 2006). The present study adopts the approach of de Haan and Diewert (2013): a price index is constructed using the price generated by the estimated coefficients of a base period regression model, and it is calculated based on the based period average values of a given cell phone plan characteristic z¯ for each operator (Supplementary Table S5). For continuous characteristics, direct averages are used; for binary characteristics, the proportions of cell phone plans containing the feature are used. The resulting prices for this average cell phone plan are converted to an index by applying previously calculated pure price changes (δs). Finally, the overall hedonic price index is calculated as the weighted average of firm-level indices. Weights correspond to the relative proportion of cell phone plans by operator in the sample (0.3534 for HT, 0.3212 for Vip, and 0.3254 for Tele2).

nan,"Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloadditions have been recently extensively studied by polymer chemists for the synthesis of functional polymers (either end-functional or side-functional). The post-functionalization of synthetic polymers is an important feature of macromolecular engineering as many polymerization mechanisms are rather sensitive to the presence of bulky or functional groups. For example, a wide variety of telechelic polymers (i.e. polymers with defined chain-ends) can be efficiently prepared using a combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and CuAAC. This strategy was independently reported in early 2005 by van Hest and Opsteen [31], Lutz et al. [32], and Matyjaszewski et al. [33]. Such step was important since ATRP is a very popular polymerization method in modern materials science [34,35]. Indeed, ATRP is a facile technique, which allows the preparation of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, predictable chain length, controlled microstructure, defined chain-ends and controlled architecture [36–41]. However, the range of possibilities of ATRP can be further broadened by CuAAC. For instance, the ω-bromine chain-ends of polymers prepared by ATRP can be transformed into azides by nucleophilic substitution and subsequently reacted with functional alkynes (Scheme 3) [32].

The technique makes it possible to perform field measurements of local film thickness, resolved in both space and time, similar to the work of Alekseenko et al. (2009). The flat shape and large transverse size of the duct allow us to resolve the film thickness in transverse coordinate as well. Alekseenko et al. (2012) attempted to do this in annular downward flow, but, for technical reasons, the sampling frequency was not high enough in their experiments. More recently Alekseenko et al.

The technique allows the simultaneous study of three-dimensional wavy structures and liquid entrainment, and can improve understanding of the entrainment phenomenon.

nan,"Half metallic ferromagnets (HMF) have attracted enormous interest due to their applications in spintronic devices [1]. Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) are considered to be the best materials to show half metallicity. These materials have two components, one being a semiconducting material with diamagnetic properties while the other is a magnetic dopant such as transition metal having un-paired d electrons [2]. The major advantage of these materials is utilization of electron's spin as information carrier since advanced functionalities in spintronic devices can be viable by the use of spin degree of freedom along with the charge of electrons [3]. The major issue regarding the applicability of these materials is to enhance the Curie temperature above room temperature. That's why the research interest shifted towards large band gap materials. A lot of work has been reported on DMSs with different II–VI and III–V semiconductors as host material such as, ZnS, CdS, GaN, ZnO, ZnSe, ZnTe, TiO2, SnO2 [4–12].

nan,"A key part of this problem is that an inspector only has access to data from a small inspected area. In this area, there is only one minimum thickness, which does not provide enough information to build a model of the smallest thicknesses. An inspector can generate a sample of the smallest thickness measurements by partitioning the inspection data into a number of equally sized blocks. In each block the minimum thickness is recorded. This set forms a sample of the smallest thickness measurements. From this sample, one can build a model which takes into account the variations of the smallest thickness measurements. Extreme value analysis (EVA) provides a limiting form for this model. It states that, if the underlying thickness measurements in each block are taken from independent and identical distributions, then the sample of minimum thickness measurements will follow a generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD).

nan,"The above discussion summarizes the state of the art related to impacts and interpretations of communication latency between RT simulators. However, research is focused primarily on the effect of the data loss during the communication and how to mitigate it [34]. In the thermo-electric co-simulation example in [35], the time constant is larger in the thermal simulation than that of power system simulation. Thus the communication latency will not significantly affect the accuracy of co-simulation. In [36], the co-simulation is performed using resources at the same location without synthetically introduced delays, which means the communication latency between RT simulators is ignored. In [37], the authors have mentioned the communication latency as an important factor in the distributed simulation and that its effect on simulation stability will be studied as future work. An in-depth research about the role of communication latency and mitigation measure for geographically distributed RT simulations is identified as a technical gap and addressed in this paper.

nan,"Geomagnetic jerks are conspicuous yet poorly understood phenomena of Earth’s magnetic field, motivating investigations of their morphology and the theory behind their origins. Jerks are most commonly defined by their observed form at a single observatory as ‘V’ shapes in a single component of the geomagnetic secular variation (SV), the first time derivative of the main magnetic field (MF). The times of the gradient changes, which separate linear trends of several years, have associated step changes in the second time derivative of the MF (secular acceleration (SA)) and impulses in the third time derivative. The ‘V’ shape SV definition of jerks includes an implicit expectation of a ‘large’ magnitude step change in the gradient without definition of this scale or its threshold value other than the basic need for it to be observable in the data above the highly variable background noise. Jerks can be described by their amplitude, that is, the difference in the gradients of the two linear SV segments about a jerk, A=a2-a1, where a2 is the gradient after the jerk and a1 is the gradient before the jerk. This measure is essentially the best fit SA change across a jerk. Jerk amplitude is thus positive for a positive step in SA and negative for a negative step. Here we do not consider spatial extent in our definition and refer to individual features in one field component of a given observatory time series as a single jerk.

nan,"An early attempt to combine sets and networks in a single visualization relied on first drawing an Euler diagram then placing a graph inside it [30], however the sets were often visualized with convoluted, difficult to follow curves. In addition, only limited kinds of set data could be shown as the system was limited to well-formed Euler diagrams. Compound graphs can be used to represent restricted kinds of grouped network data [8]. Graph clusters are visualized with transparent hulls by Santamaria and Theron [39]. However, the technique removes edges from the graph and it is not sufficiently sophisticated for arbitrary overlapping sets. Itoh et al. [24] proposed to overlay pie-like glyphs over the nodes in a graph to encode multiple categories. Each set is hence represented using disconnected regions that are linked by having the same colour. This causes difficulties with tasks that involve finding relations between sets such as T1, T3 and T4 in Section 5.3. A related class of techniques visualize grouping information over graphs using convex hulls, such as Vizster [22]. However, they do not support visualizing set overlaps.

nan,"Solitons present the possibility of extended objects as stable states within Quantum Field Theory. Although these solutions are obtained from semi-classical arguments in weak coupling limit, their validity as quantal states is justified based on the associated topological conservation laws. A more curious occurrence is that of fermionic zero-energy modes trapped on such solutions. Their presence requires, according to well-known arguments [1,2], an assignment of half-integer fermion number to the solitonic states. In the usual treatment, the back reaction of the fermion zero-modes on the soliton itself is ignored. However, the fractional values of the fermionic charge have interesting consequence for the fate of the soliton if the latter is not strictly stable. The reason for this is that if the configuration were to relax to trivial vacuum in isolation, there is no particle-like state available for carrying the fractional value of the fermionic charge. Dynamical stability of such objects was pointed out in [3], in cosmological context in [4,5] and more recently in [6–8]. Fractional fermion number phenomenon also occurs in condensed matter systems and its wide ranging implications call for a systematic understanding of the phenomenon.

nan,"Production of charmonium states J/ψ and ψ′ in nucleus–nucleus collisions has been studied at CERN SPS over the previous 15 years by the NA38 and NA50 Collaborations. This experimental program was mainly motivated by the suggestion [1] to use the J/ψ as a probe of the state of matter created at the early stage of the collision. The original picture [1] (see also [2] for a modern review) assumes that charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary nucleon–nucleon collisions. During the subsequent evolution of the system, the number of hidden charm mesons is reduced because of: (a) absorption of pre-resonance charmonium states by nuclear nucleons (normal nuclear suppression), (b) interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons (comovers), (c) dissociation of cc̄ bound states in deconfined medium (anomalous suppression). It was found [3] that J/ψ suppression with respect to Drell–Yan muon pairs measured in proton–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus collisions with light projectiles can be explained by the so-called “normal” (due to sweeping nucleons) nuclear suppression alone. In contrast, the NA50 experiment with a heavy projectile and target (Pb+Pb) revealed essentially stronger J/ψ suppression for central collisions [4–7]. This anomalous J/ψ suppression was attributed to formation of quark–gluon plasma (QGP) [7], but a comover scenario cannot be excluded [8].

These monitor sets consist of different metal wire pieces that have an activation reaction at a specific energy range. The different activation energies are chosen in such a way that the spectrum can be reconstructed. In BODEX, each capsule contained a flux monitor set on the ‘back side’ (as seen from the core) and one on the front side, positioned at the central height of the capsules. Additionally, one detector was placed at the top and one at the bottom, resulting in a total of 6 monitor sets per leg. The fluence in each capsule was determined as the average between the two flux monitor located in each capsule.

By varying the population times, population relaxation dynamics and inhomogeneous broadening is revealed in the photon echo spectra. Time-integrated photon echo signals show two different timescales.

nan,"There is still some debate about the crystal structure and composition of the fine oxides found in ODS steels and a number of different phases have been both proposed and identified. A complete characterisation of the oxide particles, including crystal structure and composition, is needed as different phases and chemical variants of a single structure have been shown to respond differently to high temperatures and irradiation. Ribis and de Carlan [6] have studied the coarsening characteristics of Y2O3 and Y2Ti2O7 oxides at high temperatures. They show that the increase in particle size is greater for the non-Ti containing phase. Similarly, Ratti et al. [9], although they do not allude to specific oxide phases, have shown that small Ti additions to an 18%Cr ODS alloy dramatically reduces the coarsening rates of dispersoids when compared to an equivalent alloy without titanium. For example, Ribis indicates that coarsening rates may be controlled by interfacial energy between the secondary phase particles and the matrix; he points out that the resistance to coarsening observed in the Y, Ti, O system is probably the result of a very low interface energy and this would differ from one phase to another. Whittle et al. [10] have shown that pyrochlore and structures closely related to the pyrochlore structure respond in different ways to irradiation. They revealed that oxide structure and variations in composition can affect their ability to withstand and recover from irradiation induced damage.

nan,"Energy conservation is critical to ensure stability of a numerical method, especially for contact and collision problems  [28,43]. A number of conserving schemes have been developed to ensure energy conservation. These schemes make use of the penalty regulation of normal contact constraint and inherit the conservation property from continuum problems. These conservation schemes can conveniently be combined with the finite element method to simulate frictionless  [44] and frictional  [43] contact and collision. Hesch and Betsch  [45] formulated the node-to-segment contact method and solved large deformation contact problems with the conserving scheme. More recently, an energy and momentum-conserving temporal discretization scheme  [46] was developed for adhesive contact problems without considering friction and dissipation. Even though the conserving scheme improves numerical stability, it also inherits from the penalty method the difficulty of having to determine penalty parameters. In order to remove penalty sensitivity, Chawla and Laursen  [47] proposed an energy and momentum conserving algorithm, which makes use of Lagrange multipliers instead of penalty parameters.

nan,"Many applications in fluid mechanics have shown that surface suction can be used as an effective flow-control mechanism. For example, Gregory and Walker [1] discuss how the introduction of suction extends the laminar-flow region over a swept wing by reducing the thickness of the boundary layer and the magnitude of crossflow velocity. Conclusions for the swept-wing flow arose from equivalent studies of the von Kármán (rotating disk) flow (see Gregory and Walker [2], Stuart [3]) and work has since continued into this and related flows using numerical and asymptotic approaches (see Ockendon [4], Dhanak [5], Bassom and Seddougui [6], Lingwood [7], Turkyilmazoglu [8], Lingwood and Garrett [9], for example). The literature shows that increasing suction has a stabilising effect on the general class of “Bödewadt, Ekman and von Kármán” (BEK) flows which results in an increase in critical Reynolds numbers for the onset of convective and absolute instabilities, a narrowing in the range of unstable parameters and a decrease in amplification rates of the unstable convective modes. The convective instability results are interpreted in terms of a delay in the onset of spiral vortices, and the absolute instability results in terms of the onset of laminar-turbulent transition (Lingwood [7,10,11]).

nan,"Note that the quantitative introduction of a reactive functionality into the polymer chain end can be easily achieved by adopting the living ROMP technique especially using the Schrock type molybdenum alkylidene initiator [7,12,21,61–65]. The exclusive preparation of end-functionalized ring-opened polymers (realized by a living polymerization with quantitative initiation) can be applied not only to prepare block copolymers (ABCs) coupled with another living polymerization techniques [66], but also for preparation of macromonomers, as described below. In contrast, the initiation efficiency is not always perfect as seen in the molybdenum alkylidene initiators, because dissociation of ligand (PR3 etc.) should be required to generate the catalytically active species in the ROMP with the ruthenium carbene catalysts (Scheme 2) [67–69]. An equilibrium between coordination and dissociation of PR3 should be present even in the propagation process, and replacement of halogen with the other anionic ligand (and/or replacement of PR3 with the other neutral donor ligands/substrates) can also be considered as the probable side reactions. Importance of using the molybdenum catalysts should be thus emphasized for their precise preparations, although the initiators are highly sensitive to moisture and both monomers and solvent have to be thus strictly purified to avoid the catalyst decomposition (deactivation).

nan,"Including the O(αs) corrections, all the operators listed in (9) and (10) have to be included. A convenient framework to carry out these calculations is the QCD factorization framework [14] which allows to express the hadronic matrix elements in the schematic form: (11)〈Vγ|Oi|B〉=FB→VTiI+∫dk+2π∫01duφB,+(k+)TiII(k+,u)φV⊥(u), where FB→V are the transition form factors defined through the matrix elements of the operator O7, φB,+(k+) is the leading-twist B-meson wave-function with k+ being a light-cone component of the spectator quark momentum, φ⊥V(u) is the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) of the transversely-polarized vector meson V, and u is the fractional momentum of the vector meson carried by one of the two partons. The quantities TiI and TiII are the hard-perturbative kernels calculated to order αs, with the latter containing the so-called hard-spectator contributions. The factorization formula (11) holds in the heavy quark limit, i.e., to order ΛQCD/MB. This factorization framework has been used to calculate the branching fractions and related quantities for the decays B→K∗γ [15–17] and B→ργ [15,17]. The isospin violation in the B→K∗γ decays in this framework have also been studied [18]. (For applications to B→K∗γ∗, see Refs. [16,19,20].) Very recently, the hard-spectator contribution arising from the chromomagnetic operator O8 have also been calculated in next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in αs showing that the spectator interactions factorize in the heavy quark limit [21]. However, the numerical effect of the resummed NNLO contributions is marginal and we shall not include this in our update.

nan,"The oxide thickness is calculated using the weight gain and surface area. Artificially changing the surface profile will modify the surface area and calculated oxide thickness. SEM images of samples removed after 111 days oxidation were used to define the change in surface profile length with variation in applied roughness. The profile lengths extracted from the images were then used to modify the length of the sample and therefore the surface area. Table 1 shows the original oxide thicknesses after 111 days oxidation, the modified oxide thicknesses based on the surface profile length and the percentage difference. Results show a maximum decrease in the oxide thickness of 4% when using a surface which accounts for roughness. Comparing the change in oxide thickness between different surface finishes indicates a variation of less than 1%. As such, the impact of the variation in the profile length on the calculated oxide thickness is considered to be insignificant. In addition, if the differences in weight gain were only due to differences in surface area, rougher samples would be expected to demonstrate thicker oxides at the earliest stages of oxidation.

nan,"ELRs are particularly attractive for the synthesis of block copolymers that self-assemble into polymer nanostructures such as micelles. The first work in this area involved an elastin-mimetic di-block copolymer containing VPGEG–(IPGAG)4 and VPGFG–(IPGVG)4 as the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, respectively [49]. The resulting micelles were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and DSC was used to measure the enthalpy of self-assembly. A tri-block copolymer was subsequently synthesized and the TEM images of this polymer showed that it formed spherical aggregates [50]. Other multivalent spherical micelles have been obtained from linear elastin-like AB di-block copolymers in the temperature range 37–42°C with the aim of targeting cancer cells [51]. Bidwell et al. have also exploited the ELRs for its ability to serve as macromolecular carriers for thermally targeted delivery of drugs.

nan,"While virtualization technologies certainly reduce the complexity of using a system, and especially when working across multiple heterogeneous computing environments, they are not widely deployed in high performance computing scenarios. As its name suggest, HPC seeks to obtain maximum performance from computing platforms. Extra software layers impact detrimentally on performance, meaning that in HPC scenarios users typically run the applications as close to the ‘bare metal’ as possible. In addition to the performance degradation introduced by virtualization technologies, choosing what details to abstract in a virtualized interface is itself very important. Grid and cloud computing support different interaction models. In grid computing, the user interacts with an individual resource (or sometimes a broker) in order to launch jobs into a queuing system. In cloud computing, users interact with a virtual server, in effect putting them in control of their own complete operating system. Both of these interaction models put the onus on the user to understand very specific details of the system that they are dealing with, making life difficult for the end user, typically a scientist who wants to progress his or her scientific investigations without any specific usability hurdles obstructing the pathway.

nan,"Though, in this Letter we have constructed the Born–Infeld black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant and discussed their thermodynamical properties, many issues however still remain to be investigated. We know that Reissner–Nordström AdS black holes undergo Hawking–Page phase transition. This transition gets modified as we include Born–Infeld corrections into account. We hope to carry out a detail study on this issue in the future. Furthermore, in the context of brane world cosmology, it was found that a brane moving in a Reissner–Nordström AdS background generates non-singular cosmology [14]. However, as shown in [15], the brane always crosses the inner horizon of the bulk geometry, creating an instability. It would be interesting to study cosmology on the brane when it is moving in the charged black hole backgrounds that we have constructed. Note that since these charged holes does not have inner horizon for certain range of parameters, we may generate non-singular cosmology without creating the instabilities that we have just mentioned.

nan,"The reason to investigate the BFKL and DGLAP equations in the case of supersymmetric theories is based on a common belief, that the high symmetry may significantly simplify the structure of these equations. Indeed, it was found in the leading logarithmic approximation (LLA) [10], that the so-called quasi-partonic operators in N=1 SYM are unified in supermultiplets with anomalous dimensions obtained from universal anomalous dimensions γuni(j) by shifting its arguments by an integer number. Further, the anomalous dimension matrices for twist-2 operators are fixed by the superconformal invariance [10]. Calculations in the maximally extended N=4 SYM, where the coupling constant is not renormalized, give even more remarkable results. Namely, it turns out, that here all twist-2 operators enter in the same multiplet, their anomalous dimension matrix is fixed completely by the super-conformal invariance and its universal anomalous dimension in LLA is proportional to Ψ(j−1)−Ψ(1), which means, that the evolution equations for the matrix elements of quasi-partonic operators in the multicolor limit Nc→∞ are equivalent to the Schrödinger equation for an integrable Heisenberg spin model [11,12]. In QCD the integrability remains only in a small sector of the quasi-partonic operators [13]. In the case of N=4 SYM the equations for other sets of operators are also integrable [14–16]. Evolution equations for quasi-partonic operators are written in an explicitly super-conformal form in Ref. [17].

nan,"In recent years, the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has emerged as a more thorough alternative for locally solving conservation laws of the shallow water equations with higher accuracy  [21–27]. The DG method further involves finite element weak formulation to–inherently from conservation principles–shape a piecewise-polynomial solution over each local discrete cell, via local basis functions. On this basis, the DG polynomial accuracy is spanned by a set of coefficients, describing accuracy information, which are all locally evolved in time from conservation principles at the discrete level, with an arbitrary order of accuracy. A DG-based shallow water model appeals in providing higher quality solutions on very coarse meshes than a traditional finite volume counterpart, but is comparatively expensive to run and imposes a more restrictive stability condition for the CFL number  [28,29].

nan,"Multi-phase flows are common, in fact quite general, in environmental and industrial processes. Broadly these may be modelled as continuous problems where phases are mixed (e.g. oil–water homogenisation [36], sediment transport [18]) or interface problems where phases are distinct and interact at the interface (e.g. gas-assisted injection moulding [21], liquid jet breakup [40]). In some cases flows start as interface problems but as mixing occurs at the interface they become effectively continuous, at least locally. Air entrainment, perhaps due to wave breaking, is an obvious example. We consider here two-phase interface problems where the interface remains distinct and the density difference is high, e.g. air and water, and where one phase may be considered incompressible. The interface is transient and may become highly distorted and interconnected. Such problems have been tackled with mesh-based methods using periodic (or adaptive) re-meshing or additional phase tracking functions [40]. However, these approaches can be time-consuming to implement and prone to errors in surface representation [50] or mass conservation [34].

nan,"Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a numerical simulation method which is directly based on the NURBS-based representation of CAD models. It exploits the tensor-product structure of 2- or 3-dimensional NURBS objects to parameterize the physical domain. Hence the physical domain is parameterized with respect to a rectangle or to a cube. Consequently, singularly parameterized NURBS surfaces and NURBS volumes are needed in order to represent non-quadrangular or non-hexahedral domains without splitting, thereby producing a very compact and convenient representation.The Galerkin projection introduces finite-dimensional spaces of test functions in the weak formulation of partial differential equations. In particular, the test functions used in isogeometric analysis are obtained by composing the inverse of the domain parameterization with the NURBS basis functions. In the case of singular parameterizations, however, some of the resulting test functions do not necessarily fulfill the required regularity properties. Consequently, numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations cannot be applied properly.We discuss the regularity properties of the test functions. For one- and two-dimensional domains we consider several important classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations. For specific cases we derive additional conditions which guarantee the regularity of the test functions. In addition we present a modification scheme for the discretized function space in case of insufficient regularity. It is also shown how these results can be applied for computational domains in higher dimensions that can be parameterized via sweeping.

nan,"Fig. 11 shows the wear-mode map of RH ceramics, in which the early-stage friction coefficients and the surface roughness of the pure surface were chosen. The value of the fracture toughness of RH ceramics was calculated based on the reference data in other literature [22]. The Sc of RH ceramics was smaller than Sc,critical under all tested conditions during the initial stage of friction. Thus, the initial wear mode of RH ceramics was powder formation or plowing. In addition, powder formation and plowing can be distinguished using a dimensionless parameter (Sc⁎) and a critical parameter (Sc,critical⁎).(3)Sc⁎=HvRmaxKIc(4)Sc,critical⁎=51+10μwhere Hv is the Vickers hardness of RH ceramics [Pa]. The initial wear mode of RH ceramics was determined as powder formation under all tested conditions, as demonstrated in Fig. 12(a). Furthermore, the wear-mode map at 2×104 cycles was constructed, as shown in Fig. 12(b). In the map, all plots moved near the transition curve to plowing. In particular, the plots for RH ceramics sliding against stainless steel or Al2O3 balls were nearer than SiC or Si3N4 balls. Therefore, RH ceramics sliding against SiC and Si3N4 balls showed relatively higher wear than the other counterpart materials. Nevertheless, these results from the wear-mode maps indicated that the wear mode of RH ceramics was powder formation accompanied with microcracks under all tested conditions in this study, resulting in low wear (<5×10−9mm2/N). Indeed, the observation of the worn surfaces revealed that the catastrophic wear of RH ceramics accompanied by large brittle fracture was prevented overall, as shown in Fig. 13.

nan,"Both methods of structure solution reveal a bent conformation of the central terthiophene units of the DOTT molecule as is clearly visible in all three cases in Figure 5. However, there is a fundamental difference in the conformation of the octyl side chains. Whilst for the single crystal phase at T=100K linearly extended chains are observed (Figure 5B), a defined rotation of the octyl chains relative to the terthiophene unit is found for the three thin film phases (Figure 5A). The rotation angle of about ±70° results from a twist of the first CC single bond at the link between the terthiophene unit and the octyl chain (see arrows Figure 5A). Two features of this rotated conformation are interesting. First, a molecule with rotated side chains represents the equilibrium state of an isolated single DOTT molecule as obtained by combined MD and VASP calculations [33]. Second, the rotated conformation of the octyl chains allows a dense packing of the octyl side chains for both molecules. Interestingly, the single crystal structure at room temperature shows the twisted as well as the linear conformation of the octyl side chains within one molecule (Figure 5C).

nan,"Due to the complex nature of the thermal spray process, modelling has been playing a key role in providing some key insights for process design and operations. The relationships among processing conditions, particle characteristics, and the resulting coating properties are nonlinear and might be difficult to be unravelled by the experimental studies alone (e.g. [5–7]) Detailed information on the atomic level changes leading to changes observed at macroscale can appropriately be obtained by MD simulation and the effect of temperature and velocity can be determined more precisely. In this work, relatively simpler spray system of copper–copper particle was simulated to obtain a better understanding of particle recrystallization and solidification, and deformation mechanics and topography of the impacting particles. Using state-of-the-art methods to examine the physical mechanisms involved in the impacting behavior and structure–property relationship, it can be suggested that the consecutive layer deposition of particles can better be understood by understanding individual particle impacts. The particle–surface interaction mechanism and its relation to Reynolds number can offer information on the quality of the coating through its response to shock heating. As a general practice, engineering components are thermally sprayed in a continuous multilayer mode with cooling; therefore there is an opportunity for developing richer theoretical models for single or multiple particle impact in conjunction with actual spraying tests, so as to identify cohesive and adhesive strength, hardness and residual stresses.

nan,"It has recently been demonstrated [15] (see also [13] and references therein) that for a self-dual background the two-loop QED effective action takes a remarkably simple form that is very similar to the one-loop action in the same background. There are expectations that this similarity persists at higher loops, and therefore there should be some remarkable structure encoded in the all-loop effective action for gauge theories. In the supersymmetric case, one has to replace the requirement of self-duality by that of relaxed super self-duality [16] in order to arrive at conclusions similar to those given in [15]. Further progress in this direction may be achieved through the analysis of N=2 covariant supergraphs. Finally, we believe that the results of this Letter may be helpful in the context of the conjectured correspondence [17–19] between the D3-brane action in AdS5×S5 and the low-energy action for N=4 SU(N) SYM on its Coulomb branch, with the gauge group SU(N) spontaneously broken to SU(N−1)×U(1). There have appeared two independent F6 tests of this conjecture [19,20], with conflicting conclusions. The approach advocated here provides the opportunity for a further test.

nan,"In this paper, we present a project aiming at integrating immersive virtual reality technologies into a three-dimensional virtual world. We use an educational platform vAcademia as a test bed for the project, and focus on improving the learning process and, subsequently – the outcomes. We aim at increasing the immersiveness of 3D virtual world experience by applying motion tracking for controlling the avatar and two technologies for natural navigation: immersive projection and head-mounted display. In addition, we propose the major types of learning scenarios for the use of the designed systems.","['integr immers virtual realiti technolog into a three-dimension virtual world', 'virtual realiti technolog', 'increas the immers of 3D virtual world experi', 'natur navig', 'head-mount display', 'educ platform', 'major type of learn scenario', 'vacademia', 'learn process', 'control the avatar', 'motion track', 'immers project']","['3d virtual world experience', 'immersive virtual reality technologies', 'immersive projection', 'educational platform', 'test bed', 'learning process', 'motion tracking', 'natural navigation', 'major types', 'technologies', 'paper', 'project', 'outcomes', 'immersiveness', 'avatar', 'display', 'addition', 'scenarios', 'systems']"
nan,"The mesoporous silica particles were prepared by the surfactant self-assembly method described previously [18,24]. Briefly, a homogeneous solution of the soluble silica precursor, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), and hydrochloric acid was mixed in ethanol and water. A surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), with an initial concentration much less than the critical micelle concentration was added to lower the surface tension of the liquid mixture and act as the mesoporous structure-directing template. Aerosol solutions of soluble silica plus surfactant were then generated with nitrogen as a carrier atomizing gas using a commercially available atomizer (Model 9392A, TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN). The aerosol droplets were solidified in a tube furnace at 400°C until dry. Once dried, a durapore membrane filter, kept at 80°C, was used to collect the particles. As a final step, the surfactant was removed at 400°C for 5h via calcination. The surface of the mesoporous silica core in these studies was chemically modified with 10wt.% or 15wt.% by aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) conducted identically as previously described [17] to create a positive surface charge to increase loading efficiency of negatively charged cargo. Further, Liu and colleagues report the colloidal stability of these protocells with lipid bilayers, excess amount of liposomes (50μg liposomes per 0.5mg silica were used [18]).
