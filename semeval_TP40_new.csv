.,"There exist some interesting cases where the deformation structure becomes simple. One is the limit to the N=1/2 superspace [5], where the action should reduce to N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory with adjoint matter. Another interesting case is the singlet deformation [10,11], where the deformation parameters belongs to the singlet representation of the R-symmetry group SU(2)R. In this Letter, we will study N=2 supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory in the harmonic superspace with singlet deformation. In this case, the gauge and supersymmetry transformations get correction linear in the deformation parameter. Therefore we can easily perform the field redefinition such that the component fields transform canonically under the gauge transformation. In the case of N=1/2 super-Yang–Mills theory, such field redefinition is also possible [5]. But in this case the component fields do not transform canonically under the deformed supersymmtery transformation. In the singlet case, we will show that there is a field redefinition such that the redefined fields also transform canonically under the deformed supersymmetry. We will construct a deformed Lagrangian which is invariant under both the gauge and supersymmetry transformations. We find that the deformed Lagrangian is characterized by a single function of an antiholomorphic scalar field.

.,"Improving as well as evaluating the performance of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications by migrating them to Cloud environments are widely considered as critical issues in the field of high performance and Cloud computing. However, poor network performance, heterogeneous and dynamic environments are some series of pitfalls for execution of HPC applications in Cloud. This paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance and scalability of HPC applications on Amazon's HPC Cloud. The evidence from our approach points a significant improvement in speed up and scale up with the response rate of more than 20 percent parallel efﬁciency on the Cloud in comparison to dedicated HPC cluster. We state that the EC2 Cloud system is a feasible platform for deploying on-demand, small sized HPC applications.","['poor network perform', 'ec2 cloud system', 'high perform and cloud comput', 'small size hpc applic', 'respons rate', 'hpc', 'parallel efﬁcienc', 'migrat them to cloud environ', 'scale up', 'cloud', 'cloud environ', 'hpc cluster', 'propos a new approach to improv the perform and scalabl of hpc applic', 'hpc applic', 'heterogen and dynam environ', 'improv as well as evalu the perform', 'execut of hpc applic in cloud', 'high perform comput', 'speed up', 'deploy on-demand', ""amazon' hpc cloud""]","['dedicated hpc cluster', 'poor network performance', 'ec2 cloud system', ""amazon's hpc cloud"", 'high performance computing', 'hpc applications', 'cloud computing', 'critical issues', 'dynamic environments', 'significant improvement', 'response rate', 'feasible platform', 'applications', 'performance', 'field', 'heterogeneous', 'series', 'pitfalls', 'execution', 'paper']"
.,"Historically, the interest in accurate measurement of DNI started decades ago. Early studies (e.g., Linke, 1931; Linke and Ulmitz, 1940) identified the difficulty of separating the measurement of DNI from that of the diffuse irradiance in the immediate vicinity of the sun, hereafter referred to as circumsolar irradiance. Pastiels (1959) conducted a detailed study of the geometry of pyrheliometers, and how that geometry interacted with circumsolar radiance, using simplified representations of the latter. Various communications were then presented at a WMO Task Group meeting held in Belgium in 1966 (WMO, 1967) to improve the accuracy of pyrheliometric measurements, including estimates of the circumsolar enhancement. Ångström (1961) and Ångström and Rohde (1966) later contributed to the same topic, followed years later by Major (1973, 1980). The whole issue of instrument geometry vs. circumsolar irradiance was complex and confusing at the time because different makes and models of instruments had differing geometries. This was considerably simplified after WMO issued guidelines about the recommended geometry of pyrheliometers, which led to a relatively “standard” geometry used in all recent instruments. The experimental issues related to the measurement of DNI are discussed in Section 3.2.

.,"In the NJL model studied here, we find no stable stars with either CFL or normal quark matter cores. This is the opposite of the prediction of Ref. [15] where it was argued that there is no 2SC phase in compact stars. Let us be more precise: performing a Taylor expansion in the strange quark mass, the authors of Ref. [15] found that in beta-equilibrated electrically and color neutral quark matter the 2SC phase is always less favored than the CFL phase or normal quark matter. From this observation they concluded that the 2SC phase is absent in compact stars. In contrast to this result, it was shown in Ref. [16] in the framework of the NJL model that neutral 2SC matter could be the most favored quark phase in a certain regime. However, the authors argued that this interval might disappear if the hadronic phase is included more properly. This is indeed what we found for parameter set RKH, while for parameter set HK the 2SC phase survives only in a tiny window. Nevertheless, if Nature chooses to be similar to this equation of state, it will be this tiny window which gives rise to hybrid stars, whereas the CFL phase would be never present in compact stars.

.,"Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiographic (3D-DSA) images from diagnostic cerebral angiography were obtained at least one day prior to embolization in all patients. The raw data of 3D-DSA in a DICOM file were used for creating a 3D model of the target vessel segment. These data were converted to standard triangulation language (STL) surface data as an aggregation of fine triangular meshes using 3D visualization and measurement software (Amira version X, FEI, Burlington, MA, USA). An unstructured computational volumetric mesh was constructed from the triangulated surface. Smoothing and remeshing followed as next steps. The STL file was then transferred to a 3D printer (OBJET30 Pro; Stratasys Ltd., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). The resolution of the build layer was 0.028mm, and the 3D printed vessel model was produced using acrylic resin (Vero). Following immersion in water for a few hours, the surface of the 3D printed model was smoothed by manually removing spicule.

.,"In contrast with polymers, which are typically synthesized in the liquid phase, SWNTs are produced through a variety of synthesis techniques that typically involve the reaction of a gaseous carbon feedstock to form the nanotubes on catalyst particles. MWNTs were first observed in arc discharge fullerene reactors [1,26]; this technique was later adapted to produce SWNTs [3]. Similarly, the fullerene production method of laser ablation [27] was adapted to produce SWNTs (∼1.4nm diameter) in larger quantities on metal catalyst particles [28–30]. A number of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes have been developed to grow SWNTs and MWNTs, all involving the reaction of a gaseous carbon compound as feedstock. These processes include fluidized bed [31], “carpet” growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from catalyst particles embedded in a substrate [32–35] as shown in Fig. 3, and “catalytic gas flow CVD” [36,37]. One of the most effective, cheap, and scalable CVD techniques is the HiPco (high-pressure CO) process, which does not use pre-formed catalyst particles unlike most other CVD techniques [38].

.,"It is difficult in directly predicting permeability from porosity in tight sandstones due to the poor relationship between core derived porosity and permeability that caused by the extreme heterogeneity. The classical SDR (Schlumberger Doll Research) and Timur-Coates models are all unusable because not enough core samples were drilled for lab NMR experimental measurements to calibrate the involved model parameters. Based on the classification scale method (CSM), after the target tight sandstones are classified into two types, the relationship between core porosity and permeability is established for every type of formations, and the corresponding permeability estimation models are established. Field examples show that the classification scale method is effective in estimating tight sandstone permeability.","['classif scale method', 'permeabl', 'poros', 'csm', 'experiment measur', 'timur-co model', 'calibr the involv model paramet', 'calibr', 'field exampl', 'permeabl estim model', 'schlumberg doll research', 'nmr', 'sandston', 'sdr']","['lab nmr experimental measurements', 'tight sandstones due', 'schlumberger doll research', 'involved model parameters', 'classification scale method', 'tight sandstone permeability', 'permeability estimation models', 'timur-coates models', 'extreme heterogeneity', 'classical sdr', 'field examples', 'core samples', 'poor relationship', 'core porosity', 'core', 'relationship', 'difficult', 'unusable', 'csm', 'types']"
.,"We shall establish the variational format in the space–time domain S=defΩ×I, for given spatial domain Ω and time domain I=(0,T), for a quite broad class of problems involving a first order time-derivative. In particular, the coupled problem of consolidation of geomaterials falls within this class. Another interesting application is the problem of dynamics, rewritten in first-order form, i.e. through a Hamiltonian description. It is of considerable interest to note from the outset that, due to the forward transport of information in time, it is always possible to consider a set of finite time intervals, whereby the solution at the end of any such interval will act as the initial data for the next one. To this end, we introduce a partition 0=t0<t1<⋯<tN=T of the considered time domain I=(0,T) into time-intervals In=(tn−1,tn) of length Δtn=tn−tn−1.11The abbreviated notation Δt=Δtn will be used henceforth for the current time step associated with In.
